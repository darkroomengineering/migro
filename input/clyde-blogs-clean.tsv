10 Ways for Retailers to Improve Customer Lifetime Value (LTV/CLV)	10-ways-for-retailers-to-improve-customer-lifetime-value-ltv-clv	10 Ways for Retailers to Improve Customer Lifetime Value (LTV/CLV)	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f85a8f1c753657e08888bdf_Clyde_Visual_Exploration-02.png	<p>Which do you think is a more sustainable way to grow your business: acquiring new customers or making your current ones happier?<br></p><p>While lots of retailers spend tons of time—and even more money—on the former, research suggests it’s the latter. <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/">It costs five times more</a> to bring in a new customer than it does to keep one you already have.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here are 10 ways you can grow your business, make your current customers happier, and increase customer lifetime value. We’ve broken them up into two categories: ways you can make your current customers happier, and ways you can encourage them to buy more. (The two are definitely related!)<br></p><h2><strong>First, what is customer lifetime value (CLV) and what drives it?</strong><br></h2><p>Customer lifetime value is the total profit or revenue generated through a single customer over the course of their relationship with your business.<br></p><p>There are multiple ways to calculate CLV, including using probabilistic models, but in its most basic form, CLV takes a customer’s <em>average purchase size</em><strong> </strong>x the <em>number of purchases they make per year </em>x <em>the number of years they stay a customer</em>. It’s similar to RFM analysis that looks at a customer’s <strong>r</strong>ecency, <strong>f</strong>requency, and <strong>m</strong>onetary value.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If a customer comes onto your site or into your store, buys one thing, and never comes back, their CLV is relatively low.<br></p><p>But if you can keep a customer for longer, like by offering excellent goods or services that they regularly need, providing top-notch customer service and care so that they prefer to work with you over your competitors and stay with you even through issues, showing them that your business’s values are aligned with theirs, and finding ways to integrate your offerings into their lives and buying patterns (like through subscriptions or loyalty programs), that CLV can keep growing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A high CLV is key to a business’s long-term success. Bringing in tons of new customers is great. But if it costs an arm and a leg to bring a new customer in and then that customer is worth only half an arm over the course of their relationship with your product or service, you’re in trouble. One of the most important KPIs for a business is their CLV:CAC ratio, or their customer lifetime value versus their customer acquisition cost.<br></p><p>If you can improve customer lifetime value, you can secure the long-term financial success of your business.<br></p><h2><strong>10 ways to increase customer lifetime value</strong><br></h2><p>Our first five suggestions focus on how to make your current customers happier, with the secondary consequence of them buying more, and the second five focus on how to increase each purchase order through specific sales techniques.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>1. Perfect your issue resolution process.</strong><br></h3><p>Despite the best-laid marketing, production, and fulfillment plans, something will go wrong, at some point, for some customer. They won’t be happy with what they ordered, your product will break, or logistics issues will leave them feeling frustrated.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Make sure your customer service team is empowered to provide actual solutions for those disgruntled customers. That means seeing CS as as vital a part of your business as your product team and giving them the budget, autonomy, and training they need to fulfill their very important role.<br></p><h3><strong>2. Be kind.</strong><br></h3><p>Your customers are people, and people love being celebrated and made to feel special. Little touches in product fulfillment or marketing plans can highlight the shared humanity between your team and their customers. Add homemade thank-you cards to big orders, offer a free product to a customer who shares on social or on the phone that they’re having a rough day, or send surprise birthday gifts to repeat customers.<br></p><h3><strong>3. Be transparent about long-term improvements.</strong><br></h3><p>People like to feel like they’re being listened to. That’s especially true for customers, who expect that the money they spend with you earns them a voice with you. And it should! Regularly ask you customers for feedback and details on their pain points and use those to inform your planned improvements.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Whether you’re fixing a shopping cart bug, providing a wider range of color options for a product, or using more eco-friendly packaging, make sure to tell your customers not just what you’re doing to improve your products or services but also how those improvements are in direct response to their feedback.<br></p><h3><strong>4. Review your reviews.</strong><br></h3><p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923618300861">Most people use reviews to make purchasing decisions</a>, but the majority of people who are inspired to leave reviews are those who have had bad experiences. (That makes sense, as frustration can be a much bigger motivator than joy.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keep an eye on your customer reviews in two ways. First, make it easy for customers to leave their feedback with automatic, non-pushy email reminders and giveaways for those who complete them. Second, respond directly in an honest, humble, and not at all defensive way to negative reviews on public forums like Google or Yelp to show customers that you acknowledge your mistakes and make up for them.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>5. Provide useful resources with no obvious sales angle.</strong><br></h3><p>No one likes being hit up for money every time they open an email or answer the phone. Your communication with your customers shouldn’t be <em>all</em> directly tied to sales goals. Consider your expertise and your customers’ needs and find ways to bridge them and bring joy to your buyers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For instance, if you sell baking supplies, you could invest in blog pieces that research the most popular cookie recipes by season or email out expert advice on how to keep holiday treats fresh. Neither kind of content would focus explicitly on getting people to buy more baking sheets, but you’d be cementing your brand’s status as a helpful expert in that space and nurturing your relationship with customers.<br></p><h3><strong>6. Upsell.</strong><br></h3><p>Upselling is when you offer your customers a more expansive, expensive, or complete version of your product or service. That can mean getting them to buy a premium version of your low-cost software, to add-on an extended warranty to a tech purchase, or to spring for extra features on a product.<br></p><p>For example, retailers who offer extended warranties through Clyde see average purchase orders increase by 11%.<br></p><h3><strong>7. Cross-sell.</strong><br></h3><p>Cross-selling is offering your customers products that are related to things they’ve already bought from you, like when you’re buying flowers online and you get asked if you want a vase, too. This works well in the moment, as part of your checkout cycle, whether you name it (“Customers Who Bought This Also Bought…”) or not.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But you can also incorporate cross-selling into follow-up email marketing campaigns. If someone bought a couch from you last month, a customized email highlighting couch-friendly accessories like throw pillows, rugs, and blankets might do very well indeed.<br></p><h3><strong>8. Incentivize the next order.</strong><br></h3><p>An ideal repeat customer is one that returns to your product not just once, but time and time again. Make that as easy for them as possible. You can offer discounts, though be smart about your discount strategy so as to not hurt your brand, or you can stagger loyalty bonuses, like when department stores give buyers gift cards that can only be used the following month.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f85a7c65ca5ae2ddb7ca21a_gHfCEqdgGdys2umI3YNNVocbR5PCAW80bliY_2BP69Tym1S3u_YP_QowiWBKGNR1mNPGicY1Q-tfpiDBjilFbE4hYj589qHPZXUyXGtju_UnZUQzGBkPCieq1ELtylsi4bAQxOqy.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h3><strong>9. Offer exclusive access to new products.</strong><br></h3><p>Your customers are people who already have a proven need for your products or services—so why not start with them when you have something new to share?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s say you’re a video game company. If you’re about to release a new high-end game, one of your most important (and highest-converting) marketing groups should be people who bought your last game. Play into our psychological desire for exclusivity and let them know they’ll be the first people who can access your new release.<br></p><h3><strong>10. Reward repeat customers.</strong><br></h3><p>I have at least six coffeeshop and frozen yogurt punch cards in my wallet. It’s a ridiculous collection: I no longer live in any of the three cities they hail from <em>and</em> I don’t even like either coffee or frozen yogurt. (Give me tea or ice cream any time.) But I keep them, and every time I visit Chicago or New York or Ann Arbor, I make an active effort to frequent those places for meetups with old friends or ex-coworkers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Rewarding customers for having long relationships with your brand can be an extremely low-cost way to keep customers coming back, whether you do it with something as simple as a punch card or as comprehensive as a credit card points system.<br></p><p>Sephora’s Insider program is a great example of how to reward customers. The beauty company gives its consumers one point for every dollar spent and then allows customers to use those points to unlock exclusive products and trials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>Remember, there are two ways to improve customer lifetime value.</strong></h2><p><strong>‍</strong><br>You want to both make it easier for your current customers to buy more of what they need, and make it easy for customers to buy what they need <em>from you</em> by building a relationship with them over time. Just doing one isn’t enough. So while you may not implement all 10 of our suggestions right now, make sure you’re picking a few from to get the most benefit.</p>	Tue Oct 13 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
16 Ways to Celebrate Pride	16-ways-to-celebrate-pride	16 Ways to Celebrate Pride	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60d5d804747c819c28fe3406_Pride%2001.png	<p><br></p><p>Pride is celebrated in June to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/why-is-pride-month-celebrated-in-june">started on June 28, 1969</a> when police raided the gathering place frequented by gay, lesbian, bisxual, and transgender people. Trans women of color <a href="https://www.jcfs.org/response/blog/history-pride-part2">led the movement</a>, and now, 50+ years later, Pride has grown from a fight for equal rights to a celebration of the progress made by LGBTQIA+ activists and allies in securing those rights.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Pride is a joyous celebration, but it’s also a moment to honor the activists who made that celebration possible and to commit to continuing their mission. There’s still a lot of work to be done to ensure that the world is a welcoming place for LGBTQIA+ individuals and families.<br></p><p>At Clyde, we believe in doing that work as a company. From <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/clydes-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-a-transparent-update">pursuing ongoing DEI training to ensuring that our team is made up of diverse perspectives</a>, we’re committed to standing for equality and dignity for all. We do that during Pride, but also all year round, through things like offering inclusive parenting benefits for our employees, making donations to LGBTQIA+ advocacy groups, and sharing ways for our great community to show up and support.<br></p><p>Just like our platform makes product protection easy, we wanted to make it easy to show support for the LGBTQIA+ community this Pride and beyond.

25 Brands Offering Lifetime Warranties and Guarantees That Your Business Can Aspire To	25-brands-offering-lifetime-warranties-and-guarantees-that-your-business-can-aspire-to	25 Brands Offering Lifetime Warranties and Guarantees That Your Business Can Aspire To	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6197e723fe94f52f8e0ad4b2_Lifetime%20Warranties%2004.jpg	<p>We’re calling it now: product protection is the new free shipping.</p><p>In the early 2000s, Amazon basically invented the free shipping game as a way to address a key customer problem: buyers didn’t want to have to pay to get their items to them. They started offering the bonus for orders over $99, then dropped it to $49, then $25, and eventually rolled it into other services offered as part of Amazon Prime.</p><p>Nowadays, every eComm retailer worth their salt offers some version of free shipping to entice customers to buy.</p><p>And we expect the same thing to happen with product protection.</p><p>Offering a guarantee that a customer is covered if their purchase breaks address another common customer problem. It shows that you, as a retailer, stand by your products, and that you’ve got your customer’s back in case anything goes wrong. And it ups customer satisfaction and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/product-warranties-customer-loyalty">loyalty</a>.</p><p>Here, we look at brands that have long offered lifetime warranties as a way to convince customers that their products are a good buy. We’ll also cover some newer players who are hopping on the trend.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is a lifetime warranty and how are companies able to offer them?</h2><p>First off, we need to define some terms. Let’s go through <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/warranties-101">Warranties 101</a>:<br></p><ul><li>A <strong>warranty</strong> is a guarantee that a product will function as described and intended. Consumer products are not required by law to have warranties, but if one is given, it must comply with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and be clear, fair, and enforceable</li><li>A <strong>limited warranty</strong> is a guarantee from the manufacturer of the product that the product will work as intended. They come with no additional cost to the consumer.</li><li>An <strong>extended warranty </strong>is an optional extension of the term length of the limited warranty. (If the limited warranty was for one year, an extended warranty might be for two or three or five.) These are purchased by the consumer for additional cost, and cover everything in the limited warranty as well as wear and tear and power surges.</li><li>A <strong>lifetime warranty </strong>is a guarantee that a manufacturer will repair or replace any defective parts for their products and comes at no additional cost. The “lifetime” may reference the suggested lifetime of the product (when used as intended), or the time that the product is in production (or some years after that date). It rarely means the lifetime of the buyer.<br></li></ul><p>So to summarize: lifetime warranties are ways for manufacturers or sellers to double down on their products’ quality. But because they don’t come with additional cost to the consumer, the risk that the product does need replacement or repair is entirely borne by the manufacturer or seller. That’s different from the extended warranties we offer at Clyde, since they cost consumers extra and thus bump up retailers’ <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/increasing-margin-and-aov">margins and AOVs</a> along the way.<br></p><p>When does it make sense for a retailer to offer a lifetime warranty? Well, they need to meet a few conditions:<br></p><ul><li><strong>They have to believe in the quality of their products.</strong> If something was made poorly and is going to break in the first year of use, retailers are at risk of losing a lot of money repairing and replacing shoddy products.</li><li><strong>They have to be able to make repairs or replacements. </strong>A roofing company might have an easier time going in and making fixes under a lifetime warranty than an electronics company who doesn’t have in-house repair services. Retailers don’t want consumers to have failures with their items, but if they do, they need a way to address them.</li><li><strong>They have to be able to price appropriately to account for the risk they’re taking on. </strong>Retailers need to have a sense of the fail rate of their product. How often will they need to repair or replace it? How much will that cost? What does that mean they should do to their prices to cover their liabilities? There’s a lot of math in warranty calculations, just like any other kind of insurance market.</li><li><strong>They have to define “lifetime warranty” in a way that works for them. </strong>Some retailers’ lifetime warranties apply only to the original purchaser, whereas others can go through multiple owners and still be valid. Retailers will need to determine their warranty term, any exclusions, and how they’ll price products.<br></li></ul><p>Not every business can or should offer lifetime warranties. But if they’re right for yours, they certainly come with benefits, including:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Branding opportunities. </strong>LL Bean’s lifetime warranty was so famous in 1987 that it merited an entire <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204795304577223773245318712"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> article</a>. You can’t buy that kind of press coverage. And as you’ll see in the examples below, many companies actually turn their warranty program into an extension of their marketing efforts, connecting it to their brand values.</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6197e73e14e772f31359c0ec_CB-vCEhstfqzoHS5EogjVoTwPuD173_1o7IW48EGgl2adaR5Vv45jpgeX7vO_pv5VSJHKJrGVDFms_O9Q5rI24T-7EMHZGNfQWMkqguhSEczjostaG9WUg0papwoC0NIIwUOldKT.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Increased customer loyalty. </strong>Loyal customers will end up <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/building-loyalty-with-newly-acquired-customers">spending more in the long run</a>, and telling customers that they’re covered if something happens to their product is a pretty good way to get them to stick around.</li><li><strong>Differentiation.</strong> If a customer is choosing between a product with a lifetime warranty and one without, they’re more likely to choose the former, even if it comes at a slightly higher cost. A lifetime guarantee may even dissauge would-be competitors from getting in the mix, showing them they’re unlikely to successfully win away business.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><h2>25 Brands With Stellar Warranty Deals You’ll Want to Give Your Customers</h2><h4>Clothing Brands With Lifetime Warranties</h4><p>1. Patagonia</p><p>The eco-conscious outdoor retailer is well-known for their <a href="https://help.patagonia.com/s/article/Ironclad-Guarantee">Ironclad Guarantee</a>, which states:<br></p><p><em>If you are not satisfied with one of our products at the time you receive it, or if one of our products does not perform to your satisfaction, return it to the store you bought it from or to Patagonia for a repair, replacement or refund. Damage due to wear and tear will be repaired at a reasonable charge.</em><br></p><p>Simple, clear, and generous—this is one of the best lifetime warranties out there.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Eddie Bauer</p><p>Outdoor clothing retailer Eddie Bauer offers an <a href="https://www.eddiebauer.com/custserv/customer-service-our-guarantee.jsp">“Unconditional Lifetime Guarantee”</a>:</p><p><em>Eddie was one of the first retailers to offer an unconditional guarantee in writing-he was that confident and committed to the quality of his products. And after 50 years in business he said, "My greatest contribution to the consumer was our 100% unconditional lifetime guarantee. That guarantee was part of what I sold." Eddie's philosophy guides us to this day. Every product we sell is designed to be the best and built to last. If anything you buy falls short of those standards, you're invited to return it at any time.</em></p><p>3. The North Face</p><p>This sport brand offers a <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com/help/returns-warranty.html#warranty">Limited Lifetime Warranty</a>:<br></p><p><em>​​Our products are fully warranted against defects in materials and workmanship with a lifetime guarantee. Exclusions apply.</em><br></p><p>Those exclusions include footwear, damages from accidents / improper care / normal wear and tear, and anyone other than the original owner. They also specify that the warranty is for the lifetime of the product, not the lifetime of the buyer. To use the warranty, buyers need to send the clean, broken product in a prepaid, insured package with a warranty form to North Face’s repair department.&nbsp;</p><p>4. L.L. Bean</p><p>The outdoor retailer <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/09/584493046/l-l-bean-scraps-legendary-lifetime-return-policy">made headlines again</a> when it scrapped its lifetime guarantee in 2018, but it still offers a <a href="https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/513705?page=our-guarantee">guarantee</a> that it plans to generously interpret:<br></p><p><em>If you are not 100% satisfied with one of our products, you may return it within one year of purchase for a refund. After one year, we will consider any items for return that are defective due to materials or craftsmanship.</em><br></p><p>For example, in that NPR article, a man was able to get a new pair of boots after bringing the pair he bought four years ago that had broken stitching.</p><p>5. Canada Goose</p><p>The outerwear brand’s <a href="https://www.canadagoose.com/at/en/warranty/warranty.html">warranty policy</a> states:<br></p><p><em>Canada Goose products purchased from an Authorized Retailer are fully warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for the lifetime of the product – which means the usual and customary wearable life of the product, by the original owner. If a product fails due to a manufacturing defect, we will repair the product free of charge, or replace it at our discretion.</em><br></p><p>It doesn't include repairs needed due to accidents or normal wear and tear</p><p>6. Duluth Trading Company</p><p>Rugged outdoors brand Duluth Trading Company offers a “<a href="https://www.duluthtrading.com/no-bull-guarantee.html">No Bull Guarantee</a>”:<br></p><p><em>If you are not satisfied with any item you purchase from Duluth Trading, return it for a refund within one year. After one year, we will also consider returns for items that are defective or don’t perform as designed. No Bull means if something goes wrong, we will always treat you right.</em><br></p><p>It includes most purchases, but excludes products damaged by misuse or improper care.</p><p>7. Carhartt</p><p>Following the theme of hardworking brands with aggressive lifetime guarantees comes Carhartt’s “<a href="https://www.carhartt.com/our-commitment">Guaranteed to Work</a>” plan:<br></p><p><em>If one of our products should ever fail to meet your expectations, we’ll work to make it right through repair, replacement, or credit. Damage due to normal wear and tear over time will be repaired at a reasonable and transparent charge.</em></p><p>8. Columbia Sports</p><p>This outerwear company offers a <a href="https://www.columbia.com/warranty_outerwear.html">limited lifetime warranty</a>:<br></p><p><em>This Limited Lifetime Warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship for the practical lifetime of Columbia Sportswear brand products manufactured by Columbia Sportswear or its affiliates. Only original, unaltered, and unmodified materials and workmanship are covered by this policy. This limited lifetime warranty does not cover damage caused by normal wear and tear, improper care, misuse, accident, neglect, or the natural breakdown of materials over time.</em><br></p><p>It specifies that the warranty is good for the “practical life of the product” and ends if the original buyer sells or transfers the product, but does not specify what that practical life is.<br></p><p>9. Tilley Endurables</p><p>This luxury hat brand offers a <a href="https://www.tilley.com/pages/new-guaranteed-for-life">lifetime guarantee</a> for some of its products:<br></p><p><em>Your Tilley hat should be treasured. We are so confident in our craftsmanship that some of our hats are Guaranteed for Life against normal wear and tear, poor workmanship, or faulty material. If your hat is Guaranteed for Life, we will repair or replace it free of charge.&nbsp;</em><br></p><p>The only catch? You must make a Tilley.com account and <a href="https://www.tilley.com/pages/register-my-hat">register your product</a> online within 90 days of purchase.</p><p>10. Filson</p><p>The rugged outdoors line offers a <a href="https://www.filson.com/guarantee.html">guarantee</a> that reads:<br></p><p><em>We believe in our products and stand by the quality of workmanship, craftsmanship and materials in each one. We guarantee the lifetime of each item against failure or damage in its intended usage.</em><br></p><p>That excludes general wear and tear and accidents and anything beyond the product’s lifespan.</p><p>11. Grunt Style</p><p>This military-inspired company offers a “<a href="https://www.gruntstyle.com/pages/beerGuarantee">Beer Guarantee</a>,” where you can send your clothing back for any reason—"<em>including tears, holes, loose threads, beer stains - even blood stains from defending the American Flag</em>”—and get a new item. If the overdone patriotism and toxic masculinity doesn’t turn you off, you’ll certainly get your money’s worth.</p><p>12. Dickies</p><p>The worker-friendly brand doesn’t offer a full lifetime guarantee, but does have a <a href="https://www.dickies.com/returns.html">satisfaction guarantee</a>:<br></p><p><em>If you purchased an item from us or from one of our authorized sellers that doesn't meet your expectations, contact us. We will reach out to you for either a refund, replacement, or a gift card. We guarantee quality and value in all purchases from our authorized sellers, and stand by the expected life of the item. Therefore, we’re happy to work with you reasonably, fairly and with you, as a customer, in mind.</em><br></p><p>The brand’s footwear also has a <a href="https://www.dickies.com/policies.html">six-month limited warranty</a>.</p><p>13. Lands End<br></p><p>Lands End used to offer a lifetime guarantee, but now only states on their <a href="https://business.landsend.com/guarantee">Business</a> page that their products are “meant to be worn, rumpled and loved” and that they can be returned or exchanged (if customers pay for shipping).&nbsp;<br></p><p>The page’s language hints at a guarantee but stops a bit shy of saying that:<br></p><p><em>We stand behind our goods and services and trust you will be happy with your purchase. In the event you're not, we have a simple </em><a href="https://business.landsend.com/returns"><em>return policy</em></a><em>. If you're not satisfied with any item, simply return it to us at any time.</em></p><h4>Work Boots, Shoes, and Footwear Warranties</h4><p>14. Darn Tough Socks</p><p>If you visit Darn Tough Socks’ homepage, you’ll see a compelling deal: get socks for life by buying seven pairs. “That’s all you’ll ever need,” a pop-up reads, “because our socks are guaranteed for life.” Here’s their “<a href="https://darntough.com/pages/our-unconditional-lifetime-guarantee">unconditional guarantee</a>,” which comes before a photo gallery of real socks sent in by customers for replacement (holes in the heels and all!):<br></p><p><em>We get it, the idea of “unconditionally guaranteed” could be interpreted differently, but we guarantee our work, and our socks. Hike to the Moon, and we will cover that kind of wear, but if you leave them there, we don’t want to assume responsibility for that. We don’t need a receipt, we don’t need a reason.</em></p><p>15. Bombas Socks</p><p>The well-known sock (and other clothing) maker has a lifetime guarantee that’s branded as their <a href="https://help.bombas.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038164474-What-is-the-Happiness-Guarantee-">Happiness Guarantee</a>, and is even more inclusive than others on this list:<br></p><p><em>If your socks don't fit, we'll help you return or exchange. If your shirt develops a hole, we'll replace it. Dog chewed up your socks, we'll replace them.</em><br></p><p>They even have a separate <a href="https://help.bombas.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003736914-What-s-with-this-Kid-Proof-Guarantee-">Kid-Proof Guarantee</a> that goes even farther:<br></p><p><em>If your kids scuff, tear, or just plain grow out their Bombas within a year, don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. We’ll replace them or send you the next size up, free of charge.</em></p><p>16. Feetures Socks</p><p>These makers of specialty running socks have a <a href="https://feetures.com/pages/faqs">Lifetime Guarantee</a> that’s pretty all-inclusive:<br></p><p><em>If our products fail to live up to your standards, you may return them at any time for a replacement - no questions asked!</em></p><p>17. Chacos Footwear</p><p>This brand’s trappy, sporty sandals are covered by a <a href="https://www.chacos.com/US/en/warranty/">warranty</a> that has no time limit, but does only address faulty materials, not wear and tear:<br></p><p><em>All Chaco products are warranted to be free of defects in materials or workmanship for the entire life of the product.</em></p><p>18. Doc Martens</p><p>Doc Martens went the way of other retailers in early 2018 and discontinued their <a href="https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/for-life-terms-conditions">For Life</a> guarantee for their GUARANTEED FOR LIFE boots and shoes. It was a truly unique lifetime warranty since it covered the failure of any competent of the boots, including and especially for normal wear and tear, “from the day on which the original owner activates their guarantee, to the end of that person's natural life.”<br></p><p>Now, they offer a <a href="https://twitter.com/drmartens/status/1120711894380240896">limited warranty</a>:<br></p><p><em>We offer a one year warranty against manufacturing defects for items purchased from our official online store or retail locations. Unfortunately items purchased outside of this period are not covered under our guarantee.</em></p><p>19. Bogs Boots</p><p>Winter, waterproof, and farm boots sold by Bogs come with a <a href="https://www.bogsfootwear.com/shop/guarantee.html">100% satisfaction guarantee</a>—though just for a limited time:<br></p><p><em>While we can't guarantee BOGS° will never wear out, we do guarantee our product is free from workmanship and material defects 1 year from the date of purchase.</em></p><p>20. Blundstone Boots</p><p>The bootmaker’s <a href="https://www.blundstone.com/warranty-claims">warranty program</a> is good only for faulty, unworn products that come with the original purchase receipt. In that case, they say:<br></p><p><em>You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and for compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.</em></p><h4>Other Apparel Brands that Offer Great Warranty Deals</h4><p>21. Jansport</p><p>The backpack brand offers a <a href="https://www.jansport.com/customer-service/lifetime-warranty.html">limited lifetime warranty</a> on its products that provides original owners with repair or replacement to address manufacturing defects only:<br></p><p><em>The products eligible for the lifetime warranty are covered to the original owner, for the lifetime of the product. Unfortunately, this does not mean your lifetime. Inevitably, well used (and well loved!) products will eventually wear out—fabrics will deteriorate, and colors will fade. Please use your judgment when assessing whether your product is likely to be covered under the warranty policy—it may simply be time to replace it.</em></p><p>22. Osprey</p><p>This outdoors-backpack brand offers a generous <a href="https://www.osprey.com/us/en/customer-support/all-mighty-guarantee">All Mighty Guarantee</a> for “any reason, any product, any era,” and proudly boasts that they’ll replace packs whether they were “produced in 1974 or yesterday.”</p><p>23. Eagle Creek</p><p>This luggage company offers a <a href="https://www.eaglecreek.com/warranty.html">No Matter What™ Warranty</a>, though it does exclude normal wear and tear:<br></p><p><em>Our Lifetime Warranty covers workmanship and materials against defect for the entire life of the product. During this period, if the product is covered by the warranty, we will repair or replace it at our discretion. Contents of your bag, normal wear and tear, abuse and cosmetic wear and tear are excluded. ‘Lifetime’ is defined as the lifetime of the product not of the purchaser.</em></p><p>24. Red Oxx</p><p>This maker of travel bags and accessories offers a <a href="https://help.redoxx.com/article/6-our-warranty">“No Bull” lifetime warranty</a> that their CEO introduces by saying, “Our products are guaranteed forever, be sure to include them in your will.” And while buyers have to pay for shipping and cleaning, the warranty does include any owner, not just the first one:<br></p><p><em>​​The Red Oxx Lifetime Guarantee is completely transferable for life. Covered are all bags and accessories made by us including Limited Editions, Special Editions, Custom bags, Corporate Promotional orders and mass produced bags, at any time in our history, regardless of how they were obtained – gifts, second hand store, ebay auctions, hand-me-downs, custom work or modifications done by Red Oxx. Our “No Bull” Lifetime Warranty is, in a word, unconditional!</em></p><p>25. Shinola</p><p>Depending on the type of watch, Detroit-based watchmaker Shinola offers different <a href="https://www.shinola.com/introducing-shinola-guarantee.html">guarantees</a>:<br></p><p><em>Shinola metal quartz and automatic watches are guaranteed for life, and the company’s TR90 resin watches are guaranteed for 3 years under the terms and conditions of our warranties. In the case of defects covered by the warranties, all components (excluding battery, leather/rubber/nylon/silicone strap, stainless steel bracelet, and buckle) will be repaired or the watch will be replaced free of charge.</em></p><h2>Give Customers The Product Warranties They Want With Clyde</h2><p>Offering a lifetime warranty is a great way to make customers happy and to show that you stand behind your products. Giving them the option to purchase an extended warranty is a good idea, too, particularly because it facilitates their long-term use of the product while also supporting your bottom line.</p><p>Ready to see how you can get Clyde’s purchase protection platform up and running on your site in just a few minutes? <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Schedule a demo today.</a></p><p><br></p>	Fri Nov 19 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
3 coronavirus ecommerce trends that might be here to stay (and 3 that probably won’t be)	3-coronavirus-ecommerce-trends-that-might-be-here-to-stay-and-3-that-probably-wont-be	3 Coronavirus eCommerce Trends That Might Be Here to Stay	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f5f984fea510f0cd8ebad79_The%20pandemic%20has%20created%20new%20e-commerce%20niches%E2%80%94are%20they%20here%20to%20stay_.png	<p>The COVID 19 coronavirus pandemic has impacted every aspect of regular life, from work to school to community gatherings. It’s also changed the way that people shop.&nbsp;<br></p><p>eCommerce saw a huge spike in the first half of the year as people stayed away from in-person shopping and transitioned to buying online. <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2020/08/25/ecommerce-during-coronavirus-pandemic-in-charts/">DigitalCommerce360</a> reported that $1 of every $5 spent in the U.S. from April to June was spent online, with 2020’s Q2 eCommerce penetration hitting 20.8% from a high of 14.7% a year prior and a total of $200.7 billion spent.<br></p><p>That spending is significant. IBM calculated that the pandemic has accelerated the shift from physical to digital shopping by about five years, per <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHQ2BfK64Fhk96hi8ZjvQam68qgFAL6qP7FJByX4YakciCFaohdK0DYCkcHA1Z0DtgccJRC5ai3BX5QSHINz6fsM-Vxp-lv-Ne3saGgPuBGOymg5J2_IDkaHAAhaRVhAzFLg5O2CqEIcDZFrACK2_zdoiscWnI4YiWBEFTOc88ci">TechCrunch</a>. Brick-and-mortar stores like Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney couldn’t keep up; both <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/business/jc-penney-bankruptcy-coronavirus.html">filed for bankruptcy this May</a>.<br></p><p>But will eCommerce growth be here to stay? Here, we look at several coronavirus ecommerce trends that might outlast the pandemic—as well as a few that probably won’t.<br></p><h2><strong>Here for the long haul: groceries, home office equipment and supplies, and hardware and home improvement products</strong><br></h2><p>It probably doesn’t surprise you to read that people are spending more money on buying food, work supplies, and home goods online, considering that we’re all working from home (or living at work, depending on what side of the bed you woke up on this morning).&nbsp;<br></p><p>What might surprise you is that analysts are expecting those three categories to continue to perform well after life has returned to something closer to normal.<br></p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that <strong>online grocery ordering</strong> will likely hold on to its popularity even once traditional, in-person grocery shopping isn’t such a risk. In March, right as the pandemic was hitting the States, <a href="https://www.supermarketnews.com/online-retail/online-grocery-sales-grow-40-2020#:~:text=E%2Dcommerce%20accounted%20for%20roughly,%25%2C%20or%20nearly%20%2438%20billion.&text=lift%20from%20the%20pandemic.">52% of consumers reported</a> having bought groceries online, which was more than double the number of shoppers who’d done the same two years prior.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keith Anderson, senior vice president of strategy and insights at an eCommerce performance analytics company, <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/co/good-company/launch-pad/changes-in-consumer-buying-after-coronavirus-pandemic">told the Chamber of Commerce</a>, “If you go to the trouble of loading your 20 or 30 items on any online grocery site, the likelihood that in a couple of weeks you’ll come back and order most of those things again is pretty high. So, when you look at the shift in consumption for that household, it really moves a lot of volume from brick and mortar to ordering online.”<br></p><p>When it comes to <strong>office equipment and supplies</strong>, demand spiked initially in April, when over <a href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/coronavirus-spending-at-office-depot-staples/">40% of U.S. workers reported working from home</a> and shared that they’d purchased office supplies like pens and paper (65% of at-home workers), new electronics like desktop monitors (29%), and office furniture (26%). And that was when shelter-in-place orders were expected to last just a few weeks or maybe months. With many people working from home for going on six months now and companies choosing to shift to permanent remote work—<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-04-03-gartner-cfo-surey-reveals-74-percent-of-organizations-to-shift-some-employees-to-remote-work-permanently2">a survey of finance leaders</a> found that 74% of organizations plan to have at least some employees work from home permanently—demands on home office equipment should hold steady for a while.<br></p><p>Demand for PCs, desks, office chairs, and more might not stay at pandemic peaks, but will probably continue to average higher sales than in the past, at least on an individual consumer basis. (Massive orders of cubicle walls and board room furniture aren’t likely to come back anytime soon, though.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Despite headlines you may have seen on social media, <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/8/31/21404333/suburbs-housing-boom-urban-exodus-coronavirus">no, people aren’t fleeing major cities en masse during the pandemic</a>. Instead, housing markets were stalled during the first few months of the pandemic, so when they opened back up in June, activity resumed and it only looked like there was a wave of new buyers. In any event, whether people are buying new homes or just stuck in their old ones, <strong>home improvement goods </strong>saw a major spike during the pandemic, with companies like Lowe’s reporting double-digit sales gains. Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison attributed most of that growth to eCommerce sales, <a href="https://corporate.lowes.com/newsroom/press-releases/lowes-reports-first-quarter-2020-sales-and-earnings-results-05-20-20">citing that they increased 80%</a> in the first quarter of the year.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Analysts expect this focus on home improvement may last, with a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/home-improvement-projects-are-underway-during-covid-19-with-millennials-spending-the-most-says-bank-of-america-2020-06-24">Bank of America report</a> noting that 70% of people have decided to tackle home improvement projects during the pandemic with more planned for 2021. “Although we expect some near-term deceleration as parts of the population go back to their places of business and spend less time at home, COVID-19 could provide a longer-term benefit for home improvement stocks if it ultimately does cause an increase in housing turnover as our survey may suggest,” read the report.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>Short-term coronavirus eCommerce trends: disinfectants and medicine, entertainment, and personal care and grooming</strong><br></h2><p>The first wave of pandemic shopping made sense. A report on the fastest-growing eCommerce categories in March of 2020 highlighted some products that might’ve found their way into your virtual shopping cart: disposable gloves, cough medicine, vitamins, and more saw major demand spikes as consumers tried to get ahead of the coming risk and stock up to fight it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>[Source,: <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/shoppers-buying-online-ecommerce-covid-19/">https://www.visualcapitalist.com/shoppers-buying-online-ecommerce-covid-19/</a>]</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f5f7ec440a3046e537306b0_GbgvEe-IWDZ9Xy6OzofesjmpNFok9byz5Zhq4ByURNbZwJd6ODKCFnOGjjsmKDci9AV_WfWBsF01-QFfF-IcUDDNbpRr8GAAHvB23qvWsFButrl4lnFumEljO2nh84TEznL0yP6J.png"></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/shoppers-buying-online-ecommerce-covid-19/">‍</a></figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>But <strong>pandemic purchases like masks and disinfectant </strong>are unlikely to last.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, while a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/survey-us-consumer-sentiment-during-the-coronavirus-crisis">McKinsey study</a> says that up to 70% of consumers will continue wearing face masks for the rest of the year, the majority of Americans (72%) are wearing reusable cloth masks, so spikes like the one Etsy saw last quarter, when they sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356208/etsy-mask-sales-q2-earnings-covid-19-coronavirus-2020">$346 million of masks alone to over 4 million people</a>, aren’t likely to be repeated. (Even Etsy’s CEO called those sales “pretty volatile” and “hard to predict.”) After the initial surge of disinfectant purchases in March, <a href="https://blog.marketresearch.com/sales-of-surface-disinfectant-wipes-surge-during-pandemic">analysts expect </a>the demand for products like disinfecting wipes to fall gradually through 2021.<br></p><p>After consumers got their basics covered, they had to find a way to stay busy indoors, and <strong>entertainment products like books and streaming services </strong>saw major spikes in sales. A <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/19/coronavirus-what-americans-are-buying-online-while-in-quarantine.html">CNBC report</a> found that online book sales were up 295% year-over-year in mid-April, beating out even cleaning supplies as the top eCommerce category for growth.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f5f7ec29a79a26a937b74d2_29t-Dvq6xoxooq0rL16Bns1CQ7DGGH__Q_-lf1CXWQ5G4QWUXdISlyZxOBxxPqNppomRIbrLcTlnPOW8Qk3yMxvmApjtLBObfiluJnN5px7ptk8Ic8muVsYIBa1Wjn2sh4m43qMc.png"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>But industry analysts aren’t anticipating that spikes in entertainment eCommerce spending will last past the pandemic. For example, Netflix announced <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/16/21327451/netflix-covid-earnings-subscribers-q2">that they gained 10 million subscribers</a> in April, May, and June as people were stuck at home, but also flagged that they’re unlikely to maintain that growth in the second half of this year and may even lose some of it due to the reduction in original content they’ll be facing next year, thanks to slowed or shut-down production.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Jim Nail, a principal analyst at Forrester, told <em>Ad Exchanger</em> that he doesn’t expect increased spending on online entertainment to continue post-pandemic and instead expects to see some of that spending to go towards things like movies: “I’m sure Netflix is seeing a huge spike and will continue to for weeks or months. But I suspect there’s going to be a pent up desire to get the hell out of the house.”<br></p><p>That same logic may apply to current spikes in <strong>personal care and grooming spending</strong>. With salons closed in many states and operating with reduced capacity and demand in others, sales of hair clippers and trimmers were <a href="https://www.criteo.com/insights/coronavirus-shopping-trends/">up by 312% around the world in March and April</a> and hit 241% growth in the States alone. But even though consumers have taken their hair care into their own hands for now, that change in behavior isn’t likely to be permanent. McKinsey’s <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/survey-us-consumer-sentiment-during-the-coronavirus-crisis">newest findings</a> suggest that people are planning to return to in-person grooming once it’s safe, meaning that those spikes will probably be temporary.<br></p><h2><strong>Looking towards the future </strong>&nbsp;<br></h2><p>Unfortunately, with an uncoordinated federal response and a failure to listen to the scientists, we’re still a long way off from being through with the coronavirus pandemic in the States. We can look to other countries to see what might await us, though. In China, for instance, where the coronavirus pandemic slowed down in the first quarter, physical consumer goods sold online <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/20/china-offers-glimpse-into-post-coronavirus-retail-industry-bain-report-says.html">climbed 6% compared to last year by the end of Q2</a>, suggesting that the overall shift towards eCommerce has some staying power, even as individual categories see an evening-out of demand over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	Mon Sep 14 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
4 eCommerce Trends for 2022	4-ecommerce-trends-for-2022	4 eCommerce Trends for 2022	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61f18f9a321d7ca660ec62d8_eCommerce%20Trends%20Report.png	<p>Anyone feeling a little deja vu?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s 2022, not 2021, but the pandemic still isn’t over. Dozens of industries, from retail to travel, haven’t made a full return. Last year, eComm thrived—<a href="https://martech.org/ecommerce-spending-broke-holiday-records-in-2021/">breaking records</a> along the way—but not without facing its own challenges, including backed-up supply chains. And just like Rome, supply chains can’t be built in a day, so that problem will persist into 2022.</p><p>But it’s not all Groundhog Day. New technology, new strategies, and new ways to win out over the ever-increasing competition are here, and we’ve been studying them.</p><p>In what is now an annual tradition, we’re sharing our 4 top eCommerce trends for 2022:</p><p><strong>Trend 1: AI-powered personalization is here to stay</strong></p><p><strong>Trend 2: Visual commerce will take over</strong></p><p><strong>Trend 3: Frictionless payment will be the new norm</strong></p><p><strong>Trend 4: Successful eComm will mean mastering logistics</strong><br></p><p>Take note—we were on the money when it came to the 6 trends we explored in our <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/6-ecommerce-trends-for-2021">2021 report</a>!&nbsp;</p><h1>Trend 1: AI-powered personalization is here to stay</h1><p>Customers don’t want to be shouted at. They want to be talked to gently with a message that’s been prepared just for them. According to a <a href="https://www.rokt.com/unlock-value-ecommerce-research/?utm_source=Digiday&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=personalizationSBL">2020 Forrester report</a>, 38% of customers would provide more personal information if it got them faster, easier experiences when buying.&nbsp;</p><p>And done well, personalization can lead to brand advocates and repeat customers: 68% of buyers would sign up for a loyalty program from a brand that offered personalized shopping experience.&nbsp;</p><p>But historically, personalization at scale has been hard. Hiring dozens of CX specialists to run surveys and focus groups and "customer delight" programs is expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Through a new wave of AI-enabled tools, personalization has become casual, consistent, and <strong>cheap</strong>.</p><p>That’s especially important after Apple’s data privacy rules changed in 2021. Brands now need to collect data directly from their customers in order to market to them, and AI can help with that.</p><p>Consider these ways we’re already seeing AI-powered personalization:</p><ul><li>Automatic product recommendations, email triggers, urgency messaging, and predictive targeting driven by user behavior and enabled by data platforms like <a href="https://www.dynamicyield.com/personalization/">Dynamic Yield</a> (an AI-driven platform owned by McDonald’s that <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/december/mastercard-to-add-to-services-momentum-with-acquisition-of-dynamic-yield-mcdonald-s-cutting-edge-personalization-platform/">MasterCard just announced their intent to acquire</a>—which helps prove our point that the future of commerce is online)</li><li>Content optimization tools that direct traffic to the best-performing versions of your web pages, like the tools that <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/artificial-intelligence?__hstc=89107140.264a0d9a3c4ab2a5850d9f67464d66e8.1643039530564.1643039530564.1643039530564.1&__hssc=89107140.1.1643039530565&__hsfp=1509540286">Hubspot offers.</a></li><li>Natural language chatbots that qualify and nurture leads, passing off detailed data to marketing or sales teams to follow up on with customized email flows or outreach, like the kind that <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom provides.</a></li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61f18e17cfdccaa8e0f924a6_8I6foTDGssBHr0VbW_gvy3PDzmNti9tlne8ojsbqAUAuwJxTgpgjZDp3uNjMcPZSppiuUVcXIefmvTb4reNUjIP_ZNU6mdkkX7FWZEN-T-JUnDpO5SlLd97XApcGrZGgica5vAue.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What does this trend mean for retailers?</h2><p>Two things. First, if you don’t already use AI tools (like chatbots, conversion testing, and recommendation widgets), it’s time to start.</p><p>And second, it might be time to say goodbye to the buyer persona. If you can gather specific, actionable data on your real customers, and build models of their future motivation and behavior from that, what’s the point of making it all up?</p><h1>Trend 2: Visual commerce will take over</h1><p>When you buy something online, are you more focused on looking at photos of the product or reading the text about it?<br></p><p>Don’t answer that: researchers already have. A <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341575884_Image_or_Text_Which_One_is_More_Influential_A_Deep_Learning_Approach_for_Visual_and_Textual_Data_Analysis_in_the_Digital_Economy">2020 study</a> found that image-based information influences consumers’ purchase decisions more for “search goods,” or things they’re looking to confirm the characteristics of, like size, color, and shape. Text-based information still reigns supreme for “experience goods,” or when customers want to know what other buyers thought of a product upon consumption.<br></p><p>Most importantly, the study found that when there is congruence between products’ image-based and text-based information, customers are more likely to purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>You’ll see that in modern product pages. It’s no longer sufficient to list out a few product characteristics and throw up a stock photo. Brands that sell well online are creating a holistic—and deeply congruent—view of their products, utilizing product photos, videos, user-generated content (both visual and written), and text to convert buyers.<br></p><p>It’s called <strong>visual commerce</strong>, or the practice of using compelling visual content and augmented reality to highlight their products and enhance customer experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now, the mark of a great product page is one that has at least 2-3 of the following:<br></p><ul><li>High-quality editorial photos</li><li>Dynamic images like videos or gifs that show products in movement or use</li><li>Buyer-submitted photos and videos</li><li>Product copy optimized for search</li><li>Text reviews and star ratings</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61f18e171006104d21d12b43_1wA6KHLgMQ-c9muLQ5CJPv7mFN7t2OeF0sepoTCcuXzUMOBkbw42ASvLAx_w4Xz8AjqKvo4oJsS-R9mwoysfgxE0TWejcZGU45MAbialhnGhKLZ3aUa9Tasd6ERNWzdfHD0h3Cyw.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Nordstrom’s product page for <a href="https://www.nordstrom.com/s/on-cloudflow-running-shoe-women/5139768?country=US&currency=USD&mrkgadid=3355612660&mrkgcl=760&mrkgen=glia&mrkgbflag=1&mrkgcat=&utm_content=82259947670&utm_term=pla-299367268755&utm_channel=low_nd_shopping_lia&sp_source=google&sp_campaign=6512984596&adpos=&creative=383012442841&device=c&matchtype=&network=g&acctid=21700000001689570&dskeywordid=92700049882420487&lid=92700049882420487&ds_s_kwgid=58700005465916910&ds_s_inventory_feed_id=97700000007631122&dsproductgroupid=299367268755&product_id=28698569&merchid=1243147&prodctry=US&prodlang=en&channel=local&storeid=210&locationid=9004357&targetid=pla-299367268755&campaignid=6512984596&adgroupid=82259947670&gclid=Cj0KCQiAubmPBhCyARIsAJWNpiOmcikNqxPAtSAoUdo0SXE3U_uCo01Q8vaGSvQ5z4cnJ5YBU-xG6csaAkjgEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds">these running shoes</a> includes several different photos, a video from a Nordstrom stylist handling and explaining the product.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61f18e175dc71998337d07e3_q3gE3pr5Yb9EHNyZiiULq4U4MESwt8rLjdRIxSl2nCb4t9hoOJbdR1Q6hf29yzcXPje7HpA7aFkJ-3b14m3KK-RjqYL4kql145gy98o9isBd7JDKqJaRiEE6BwKRESIGAEY8rxaY.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Nordstrom also includes interactive, user-generated content in the form of style boards that link the shoes to other purchasable products, as suggested by peers.</p><h2>What does this trend mean for retailers?</h2><p>To stand out amongst the onslaught of online content, retailers need to employ videos, high-quality photos, and even augmented reality to bring their products to life online.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Augmented reality (AR) is especially promising for beauty and fashion brands.

And what’s a good CAC?</h2><p>CAC = customer acquisition cost, or how expensive it is for you to bring on a new customer.<br></p><p>It’s calculated by dividing the <strong>money you spend on sales and marketing </strong>by your <strong>number of new customers</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Per that <a href="https://www.nfx.com/post/5-core-business-metrics/">NFX video</a>, it’s important to recognize that CAC isn’t just your advertising cost. It should include any expense required to land a customer, like the salaries of salespeople, marketers, and customer support folks. It could even include product development and improvement costs.<br></p><p>CACs can be hard to benchmark. As we wrote about in <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/three-ways-to-combat-rising-customer-acquisition-costs">this article charting CACs’ pandemic-induced rise</a>, acquisition costs vary widely by industry:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Travel</strong> has an average CAC of $7</li><li><strong>eCommerce</strong> has an average CAC of $10</li><li><strong>Financial services </strong>have an average CAC of $175<br></li></ul><p>Not all CACs are created equal, so worry more about comparing your company’s historical CACs to that of your competitors (if you can even find them).&nbsp;<br></p><p>For instance, <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/73e7570a-6aca-47df-b080-a6a069139eed">Peloton’s formula</a> for calculating their <strong>new customer acquisition cost</strong> (NCAC, which we’re calling CAC in this article) before their IPO included subtracting their profit made from fitness subscribers from their sales and marketing cost, giving them a NCAC of $5:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/621e3f207a81791babf296b9_FBpSLLz3EUuCeDkgrIv4t31Pj5KRezUThNgODekVScro5FyAgEDO7YM-XAK9YcGdwg3yHG3HpMrpKPbAFOeDaOHQpScKZn7zGkJJEDEVA0HHpwnqKZIr_mTIfYsVSAVE_fW8yDyw.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>By our standard formula—and the formula of most of the rest of the eComm industry—Peloton’s CAC would actually be $1,056, not $5.<br></p><p>Here’s another recent one, if you’re looking for an example CAC, this time in the entertainment industry: <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/02/22/roku-stock-crashes-after-earnings/">the Motley Fool calculated Roku’s CAC as $95 in 2021</a>.</p><h2>CAC-reducing tactic #1: Invest in more affordable marketing with better payoffs</h2><p>Wouldn’t it be lovely if I had a magical new marketing channel to share with you that would be 100% effective with your target audience?<br></p><p>I don’t, unfortunately.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There’s no one-size-fits-all marketing channel. Your customers might be hanging out on Instagram, or TikTok, or LinkedIn.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But wherever they are, you should be hiring <strong>other people to talk to them on your behalf.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>That’s right: a great way to reduce CAC is to <strong>use influencers.</strong><br></p><p>We’ve written about influencer marketing before: <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-to-cultivate-influencers-and-brand-partnerships">here’s a primer to what it is</a>, and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-future-of-influencer-marketing-is-here-6-trends-from-territorys-rafael-schwarz">here’s a deep dive on nanoinfluencers and the future of the field</a>.<br></p><p>Per consumer brand expert Nik Sharma, who was the former Director of Performance Marketing and then Director of DTC at flavored water company <a href="https://www.drinkhint.com/">hint</a>, working with influencers <a href="https://twitter.com/mrsharma/status/1377453531217682433">dropped the brand’s CAC by 40%</a>.<br></p><p>Influencers reduce CAC, per Sharma, because they <strong>drive down the cost of content production</strong>.<br></p><p>Instead of paying an ad agency or an in-house creative team for a snazzy video, the influencer makes it all themselves—they plan, write, edit, film, and post the video.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here’s Sharma’s advice on how to get started:<br></p><div></div><p><br></p><h2>CAC-reducing tactic #2: Make sure your product pages are primed to convert</h2><p>Even if all your ad spending dollars work to bring customers to your website…<br></p><p>…are you ready to convert them from browsers to buyers once they’re there?<br></p><p>A 2019 Salsify survey found that <a href="https://www.salsify.com/resources/report-2019-consumer-research">as much as 69% of shoppers will abandon a product page</a> if it doesn’t have enough information or details about a product.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s even higher than the percentage of buyers who will bail because a price is too high.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Boost your CAC by turning more website visitors into buyers.

It will certainly impact the way we celebrate the 2020 holiday season, including the way we shop for it.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">14 million people currently unemployed in the U.S.</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/worldwide-retail-sales-will-drop-due-to-pandemic-2020-6">experts are anticipating</a> retail sales to drop almost 6% from last year. But even if they’re spending less, people will still be giving gifts this holiday season, and retailers poised to make that experience as smooth as possible will be the ones to earn those sales.<br></p><p>With the <a href="https://martechseries.com/mobile/mobile-marketing/e-commerce-and-mobile-commerce/retailers-get-ready-survey-shows-covid-19-impact-hasnt-disrupted-consumer-holiday-shopping-plans/">large majority of shoppers planning</a> to spend more of their holiday dollars online, these are the 4 things that e-commerce retailers should do to prepare for the 2020 holiday season:<br></p><ol><li>Double down on marketing and support around Cyber Monday. With Black Friday pretty much off the table—who wants to engage in a round of fisticuffs over a half-price TV and risk exposure to a deadly virus?—online shopping will see a spike at the end of November, and you should be prepared.</li><li>Embrace non-traditional holiday gift buying categories. Formalwear, travel accessories, experiences, and jewelry might be popular in normal times, but these times are decidedly not normal, and you’re likely to see spikes in areas like furniture instead.</li><li>Ensure your customer experience is seamless. Is your website or app navigable by a novice online shopper? Do you have customer support methods that your customers will actually want to use? Is your website fast and able to handle tons of traffic? I hope the answer to all of those questions is yes, and your customers do, too.</li><li>Plan out your returns process. Not every gift will be a keeper. Are you set up to process returns and exchanges without losing customers along the way?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>We’ll dig into those four areas in more detail below.<br></p><h2><strong>1. Double down on marketing and support around Cyber Monday</strong><br></h2><p>Black Friday was already a questionable activity in the Before Times—rushing out of Thanksgiving dinner to get to shops that opened that evening, stressing out employees who had to manage chaos, packing stores to the brim—and it certainly isn’t advisable now, during a pandemic. Retailers like Target, Macy’s, Best Buy have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/07/28/thanksgiving-2020-store-closures-list-holiday-shopping-changes/5481009002/">all said they’ll close stores</a> on Black Friday, which means buyers looking for deals will be logging on for Cyber Monday instead.<br></p><p>Make sure your website is set up to handle a flood of traffic that day and that you market whatever deals or discounts you’re offering ahead of time. To give yourself a leg up, consider revamping your product landing pages as gift guides that link to other popular products and make it easy for buyers to find the best details. If you want to set your brand apart, try running a philanthropic campaign on top of Cyber Monday or offering special products or giveaways included in that day’s purchases.<br></p><h2><strong>2. Embrace non-traditional holiday gift buying categories</strong><br></h2><p>Some popular holiday categories will still be popular in 2020. For instance, kids will always want toys, and adults will always enjoy gifting them.</p><p>But others? Not so much. While clothing has long been one of the most shopped-for categories of gifts (with <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/4737_2018-holiday-survey/2018DeloitteHolidayReportResults.pdf">53% of buyers having planned to gift clothing in 2018</a>), it’s unlikely that buyers will follow that trend in 2020. Same goes for cosmetics and fragrances or jewelry (which 34% and 32% of buyers usually purchase, respectively). After all, getting a new outfit you can’t wear out of the house is a bit of a bummer.</p><p>Instead, gift categories that jive well with spending 24 hours a day in your house will see spikes, from furniture to home improvement tools to entertainment options. Considering how important it will be that those items stay in working condition for a long time, we’re expecting to see a spike in purchase protection, too, as both gift givers and receivers look to find peace of mind that will allow them to truly love and enjoy their purchases for years to come.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>3. Ensure your customer experience is seamless</strong><br></h2><p>This must-do can be broken down further into three main areas: 1) customer support, 2) website speed, and 3) shipping options. Let’s look at each one.<br></p><p>When it comes to <strong>customer support</strong>, you’ll need to keep in mind that a majority of every age group plans to do half or more of their holiday shopping online, including older age groups that haven’t been heavy adopters of online options in the past. It’s vital that you have various customer support options for each group that line up with their preferences. <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/dc/em/onesize-doesnt-fitall-cxresearch-report.pdf">That means</a> social media for Gen Z, phone calls for Baby Boomers, and chat and email options for everyone else.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f6a018fe6846f06fcc2805c_zSRzxLUHFPw7lM2RVRWUUX55KmeIuR5uxgi9XtO8ikhNt5UfsNjLUCmESNEO26aqEavHoLsONRXMyiK18RSAfP0subNgog4supOXKiAI0QS_IR5la-oDADjrSC2OVQ5e0zRlMfDu.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/majority-of-us-shoppers-will-turn-digital-holiday-shopping-needs-this-year">https://www.emarketer.com/content/majority-of-us-shoppers-will-turn-digital-holiday-shopping-needs-this-year</a></figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>For <strong>website speed</strong>, make sure that your dev team has done vigorous front-end and backend testing to make sure that your websites and/or applications can handle a sustained surge in use. Try <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/">Google’s developmental tools</a> for general speed tests and make sure to do a <a href="https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly">mobile compatibility test</a>, too.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fe0fbaced61eb45cb15e6fb_Screen%20Shot%202020-12-21%20at%202.45.46%20PM.png" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption>In a survey conducted by Ignite Visibility, almost one-quarter of consumers listed site speed as their most important factor.</figcaption></figure><p>Invest in clear <strong>shipping options</strong> at checkout that meet your customer needs. Is two-day shipping still possible? (<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2020/07/covid19-holiday-readiness-retail-commerce.html">Salesforce predicts</a> that last-mile delivery will be overcapacity in December, so double check that it will be before you promise it.) What gift-wrapping options are possible with the fulfillment staff you have? What kind of questions would you have as a buyer in this unprecedented holiday season and how are you answering those questions for your customer? Some good ones to answer on an FAQ page or as part of your checkout process: How can customers track their purchases? Are delivery dates guaranteed? Is shipping free, free with a minimum purchase, or tacked on at the end?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fe0fc643ccc377387cb4dfe_Screen%20Shot%202020-12-21%20at%202.49.31%20PM.png" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption>Ignite Visibility's survey also found that nearly half of consumers list free shipping as the most important feature when they’re shopping online.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>4. Plan out your returns process</strong><br></h2><p>If this were a normal holiday season, you’d already be ready for a good amount of returns. In 2019, for instance, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/03/most-consumers-expect-to-return-gifts-this-holiday-season.html">77% of consumers</a> planned to return some gifts and 20% planned to return more than half. Add in a pandemic where no one can try anything on or see what a product looks like in real life and it’s clear that returns will be an even more important part of the e-commerce cycle this holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p>With the USPS under some financial strain and the holiday season slated to be busier than ever, retailers need to make a plan for how returns will work. Only <a href="https://nrf.com/blog/how-retailers-can-handle-oncoming-rush-returns">40% of retailers</a> had optimized return processes pre-COVID, and if you haven’t figured yours out before December, you might be in trouble.</p><p>You can borrow your strategy from a big seller like Amazon, which is allowing customers to drop off returns at UPS stores to cut out having to print and package things at home and to reduce overall return shipping costs since items come back in bulk. Or you can try something easier to implement, like including prepaid return shipping labels in purchase orders. Just remember that your returns process can make or break your customer experience, with <a href="https://www.salecycle.com/blog/featured/ecommerce-returns-2018-stats-trends/">around 50% of consumers</a> saying they’ve stopped shopping with a brand after a bad return experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Key questions to answer in your return policy include:</p><ul><li>When is your return deadline?</li><li>What is the process for shipping products back?</li><li>Will buyers be refunded to a credit card or PayPal account or issued credit?</li><li>What if the item was purchased as a gift—does that change any of the above?</li></ul><h2><strong>Reminder: this holiday season will</strong> <strong>be unlike any other</strong></h2><p>For eCommerce retailers, the 2020 holiday shopping season represents unique opportunities for those prepared for a surge in online shopping, particularly in pandemic-friendly categories, and can offer reliable, seamless buying experiences and smooth issue resolution and return processes.&nbsp;</p><p>But at the end of the day, we’re still in a pandemic, so opportunities aside, it’s vital that retailers double down on investing in safety procedures, not just for their customers but also (and more importantly) for the workers who make it possible for their products to reach those customers.</p><p>Because at the end of the day, the holiday season is about spreading joy to the people we care about—not spreading a virus. Keep that in mind and happy holidaying!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	Tue Sep 22 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

5 Holiday Shopping Trends For The 2021 Season	5-holiday-shopping-trends-for-the-upcoming-2021-season	5 Holiday Shopping Trends For The 2021 Season	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61bccd92236027256f22d3ca_Consumer%20Electronics%20Holiday%20Gift%20Guide_%20Our%2016%20Top%20Picks%20(1).png	<p>It’s Christmas time all over the world, it’s Christmas here at home—and most of us are going to be celebrating it just like we did in 2020. Same goes for Hanukkah and Winter Solstice and any other December-y holidays you’re looking forward to this season.<br></p><p>With a slow fade away from in-store shopping, Black Friday sprees, and reliable shipping, and an increased reliance on mobile commerce and flexible delivery dates, it’s looking like holiday shopping season may never again look like what it did pre-pandemic.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s bad only if you’re a traditionalist who particularly likes leaving your cozy Thanksgiving table to stand in line for hours to get the best possible deal on an expensive electronics purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Otherwise, the trends we’re seeing are net positive. They’re about giving shoppers more flexibility and sellers more channels to make sales, and what’s not to love about that?<br></p><p>We dig into 5 specific trends we’re seeing below:<br></p><ol><li><strong>The Holiday Season Will Continue to Start Earlier and Earlier</strong></li><li><strong>The Further Death of In-Store Shopping and Irrelevance of Black Friday</strong></li><li><strong>A Continued Rise in Mobile and App Purchases</strong></li><li><strong>Buying On, Picking Up In Stores (BOPIS) Will Still Be Popular For Shoppers</strong></li><li><strong>Businesses Will Find Ways to Make Shipping Free (Or Cheaper)</strong></li></ol><p>Check out our track record: in January, we wrote about <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/6-ecommerce-trends-for-2021"><strong>6 eComm trends for 2021</strong></a>, and we’re pretty sure 100% of them came true.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. The Holiday Season Will Continue to Start Earlier and Earlier</h2><p>Let’s get this one out of the way first, since it is the trend that’s most likely to irritate you.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Mariah Carey broke out of her vault on November 1st when “All I Want For Christmas” started reappearing on the radio.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61bccd26768b5abe37ad8d3f_bpIu0sEot3mLD5rLtFcPV-7-4DEWzF8PqK18DWxSmQRa8_NX_033GbQthQgMsJZ8TGQO4fLUFyAZu5TBeWCZs4LXcwgz-ylOat1-fWbxS3z1rrfTBlP5sjp6UevuMo8gv6C0QiVn.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>But over a quarter of Americans beat her to the punch.<br></p><p>A <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/holiday-shopping-poll-2021/">survey by CreditCards.com</a> found that 27% of holiday shoppers began buying gifts before the end of <strong>September</strong>.<br></p><p>They had to. With supply chain interruptions causing shipping delays and price spikes, shoppers who want to have gifts to open on the holidays themselves needed to get a head start, per a <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/in-the-news/experts-how-to-save-money-this-holiday-season/"><em>Time</em> feature with eComm experts</a>.<br></p><p>For retailers, that means that holiday promotions—and all the creative, coordination, and technical support that they require—aren’t just a November and December thing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Campaigns starting in October means eComm sellers have to take a marathon-like approach, stretching out offers and gently coaxing would-be customers into making purchases <em>without</em> irritating them by harping on a holiday message too soon.<br></p><p>See how cookware company Caraway has approached the change, with messaging around a “Cyber Season” starting a full three weeks before traditional Black Friday / Cyber Monday:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61bccd26c9b13ac7567d9c94_v5I71vapwCzaZxxuXA4eDdM5rtjxGDAWM2W1i-LpWXtx2e5q40mkZSdZAorYeY59Kj-HG0vjDAbId-5UNYr9Q_x7QloJuUmpomWkj0MMBAzBy5-XJxIZgn_XPJ1L03ExDZhh8Puj.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61bccd26d7150279cce334ae_18F18pXJeuK2iZCIOBffAtcBU-RjcVgNwgajsV0M3Bz-iDN3IhAhb4rH4-a2vU0QgqLxqCTN54WfW_X3dIgcj3xJxpkOfkbVHwbQS19aDdR8-ricDHxBbenuvLCfFNj9Dvc5DNwN.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h2>2. The Further Death of In-Store Shopping and Irrelevance of Black Friday</h2><p>Sounds provocative, doesn’t it?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Deloitte’s <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/us164630_2021-holiday-retail-survey/DI_2021-Deloitte-holiday-retail-survey.pdf">2021 holiday retail survey</a> found that while more consumers feel safe venturing into stores, the majority of holiday spending (62%) is still going to happen online.<br></p><p>And while retailers big and small will keep promoting Black Friday deals, it’s looking like buyers really don’t care: 41% of all shoppers don’t plan on participating in any BFCM buying at all, a higher percentage than shoppers who will buy on Cyber Monday (34%), Black Friday (31%), or Small Business Saturday (20%). An <a href="https://www.adobe.com/marketing/pdf-page.html?pdfTarget=aHR0cHM6Ly9idXNpbmVzcy5hZG9iZS5jb20vY29udGVudC9kYW0vZHgvdXMvZW4vcmVzb3VyY2VzL2RpZ2l0YWwtaW5zaWdodHMvcGRmL2Fkb2JlLWhvbGlkYXktc2hvcHBpbmctcmVwb3J0LTIwMjEucGRm">Adobe report</a> found that Cyber Weekend is growing slower than the holiday season: YoY holiday spending will hit 11% in 2021, whereas BFCM spending is growing by less than half of that, at 5%.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Black Friday isn’t yet a thing of the past, but it’s certainly less relevant. As we <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/a-new-holiday-shopping-map-the-future-of-black-friday">reported on earlier this year</a>, the future of Black Friday looks like a very online holiday, with sales coming from digital marketing pushes and owned channel messaging. That’s not a bad thing: there’s still plenty of <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/cyber-week-shatters-record-attachment-rates-trend-higher">money to be made</a> and plenty of customers to satisfy.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. A Continued Rise in Mobile and App Purchases</h2><p>900 <em>million</em> hours. That’s how much time Americans will spend on mobile shopping apps in the next few months, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90683499/mobile-app-shopping-is-set-to-explode-as-klarna-afterpay-and-others-fuel-holiday-boom">found FastCompany</a>. It’s a 20% increase from last year, which was already a record-breaking year. We’re on our phones an we’re here to stay, it seems.<br></p><p>In fact, eCommerce analyst Andrew Lipsman <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/why-mobile-retail-apps-key-holiday-2021-winners-losers">told eMarketer</a> that he can predict a retailer’s holiday season success by how good their mobile app is. That’s because, he explained, mobile commerce is the fastest-growing channel (more people spending more money); apps are ever-present, with visibility on a homescreen and the ability to send notifications (more attention from all those people), and mobile apps using geolocation can enable “click-and-collect transactions.”<br></p><p>The most popular apps are Amazon and Walmart, which were on 52.5% and 28.8% of respondents’ phones, respectively. While equipment and apparel companies like Best Buy and Macy’s have less penetration (on 10% and 7.7% of phones, respectively), they have higher purchasing intent, with 90% and 95% of app downloaders planning on using the app to make a purchase this holiday season.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Businesses Will Find Ways to Make Shipping Free (Or Cheaper)</h2><p>Sure, we’re in the middle of an unprecedented supply chain squeeze.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Tell that to the kid waiting for their presents, though.<br></p><p>The majority of shoppers (85%) still expect free shipping, and they’re fairly unwilling to pay anything at all to get their gifts to their door. 88% of shoppers wouldn’t pay to get orders within 3-7 days (and those that would said they’d only pay an extra $0.60), and while 71% of shoppers said they might pay for same-day shipping, they’d only pay an average of $6 for it, per that <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/articles/us164630_2021-holiday-retail-survey/DI_2021-Deloitte-holiday-retail-survey.pdf">Deloitte survey</a>.<br></p><p>(Keep in mind that <a href="https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/Notice123.htm?_gl=1*1jqprav*_ga*MTIzMjQxMzY4Ny4xNjM3MDg3MTAx*_ga_3NXP3C8S9V*MTYzNzA4NzEwMS4xLjAuMTYzNzA4NzEwMS4w#_c026">USPS charges $27</a> for a one-day priority mail delivery of a one-pound package going within a local zone—your customers will only willingly pay a quarter of that.)<br></p><p>Faced with high expectations and equally high costs, we’re expecting businesses to find creative ways to still offer great shipping deals. That might mean offering extra incentives—like a gift card to spend on a later purchase if customers accept very-delayed shipping—or offering free shipping only at a certain purchase amount.<br></p><p>But aside from finding clever offers that make shipping possible, we also expect companies to continue meaningfully reconstructing how they conceptualize of shipping and how they invest in their operations in order to control more of it.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/supply-chain-shortage-global-firms-decide-to-manage-process-themselves?srnd=premium&sref=2rYAEfwk">Bloomberg</a> and commerce newsletter <a href="https://mailchi.mp/2pml.com/no777-5338518">2PM</a> have reported on companies like American Eagle Outfitters Inc., who has acquired only four companies in its 44-year history, including two logistics companies in 2021 to help “compete with larger companies in offering affordable same-day or next-day delivery.”<br></p><p>If you can’t beat them, buy them and bring them in-house.</p><h2>5. Buying On, Picking Up In Stores (BOPIS) Will Still Be Popular For Shoppers</h2><p>Earlier this year, we reported on the <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/what-shoppers-look-for-when-buying-online">top 15 things customers care about when shopping online</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The ability to buy online and pick-up in store, also known as click-and-collect, made it to #12 on the list.<br></p><p>This holiday season, it may even jump a couple of positions.<br></p><p>One in five online orders was collected from stores in the first half of 2021, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cd3eb255-bb3f-425b-bdf6-595852720275">reported the <em>Financial Times</em></a>, and that will continue through the holiday season. Retailers that offer BOPIS reported 63% higher digital sales in the final holiday push last season than those that did not, said the article.<br></p><p>Being able to click-and-collect collapses the time between purchase and fulfillment, cutting out any direct-to-consumer shipping issues, as well as giving shoppers a chance to inspect their items and return them immediately if there’s a problem; add on extra things while they’re browsing in-store; and get back to in-person shopping in a relatively safe and controlled way. Even when the pandemic is a thing of the past, we expect to see this trend stick around.&nbsp;</p><h2>Use Clyde to Enhance Your Customer’s Holiday Shopping Experiences</h2><p>The only thing better than getting your holiday gifts in time is making sure they’re protected against any accidents or product failures so that your loved ones can use them for years to come, without worry.<br></p><p>Clyde’s here to help with that.<br>Offering purchase protection can increase AOV while also giving your customers more peace of mind: a win-win decision this holiday season. <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Sign up for a free demo today.</a></p>	Thu Dec 02 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
6 Creative Ways Retailers Can Deal with Supply Chain Nightmares This Holiday Season	6-creative-ways-retailers-can-deal-with-supply-chain-nightmares-this-holiday-season	6 Creative Ways Retailers Can Deal with Supply Chain Nightmares This Holiday Season	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61685d47700b087257b2b4e3_Direct%20to%20Consumer%20-%20Option%203.jpg	<p>600%.<br></p><p>That’s how much more it costs to ship a standard 40-foot container from Asia to North America.<br></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/irleslie">Ian Leslie</a> is holding his breath to see how merchants react to that.<br></p><p>“Are they able to swallow that? Do they want to try to recoup some of that cost by not offering deep discounts in terms of Black Friday, Cyber Monday sales tactics? Are they even going to have product to ship?” asks the Senior Director of Retail Advocacy at one-click checkout solution Bolt.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Ian talks to hundreds of merchants each year, learning their stories and making sure Bolt’s product is serving their needs. Before joining Bolt, he was on the merchant side himself, doing marketing for a D2C furniture company. He knows his way around a supply chain, and this year has him stumped—though he’s excited to keep seeing the ways retailers are getting creative as they respond to forces outside of their control.<br></p><p>We sat down with him to hear more about what some of those responses are, as well as how changing consumer expectations will make a lasting impact on the industry.<br></p><h1>Understanding the state of supply chains<br></h1><p>Most consumers don’t know much about supply chains, <a href="https://supplychaindigital.com/supply-chain-2/comment-secret-making-customers-care-about-supply-chain">says the trade publication covering them</a>—and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/09/pandemic-supply-chain-nightmare-slow-shipping/620147/"><em>The Atlantic</em></a><em>—</em>, even though they care a lot about the outputs of them (read: the costs of goods, the shipping options available, and the environmental impact of different products).<br></p><p>In a full-disclosure moment, I have to admit that I fall—or fell, until starting work on this piece—into that “most consumers” bucket.<br></p><p>But let my crash course help you zoom through yours. There are three major steps in most supply chains: producing goods, shipping goods, and last-mile logistics of goods.<br></p><p>(Business schools will tell you there are a lot more moving parts involved, from sourcing raw material to planning demand to managing inventory. To simplify, we can put each of those under one of our umbrella topics: producing, shopping, last-mile logistics.)<br></p><p>Right now, there are problems every step of the way:<br></p><p><strong>1. Producing goods</strong><br></p><p>Raw material costs have risen thanks to growing inflation, higher energy costs, higher demand for electronics, and continued shortages (caused by both COVID-related production shutdowns as well as extreme weather).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Coal, metal, and other commodities in China are at a 13-year high, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-factory-prices-rise-fastest-pace-since-august-2008-2021-09-09/">reports Reuters</a>. It costs more to make <a href="https://www.fibre2fashion.com/news/textile-news/why-global-textile-raw-material-prices-are-on-the-rise--276699-newsdetails.htm">textiles</a>, <a href="https://time.com/6092382/car-costs-rising/">cars</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/conagra-brands-tops-sales-estimates-powered-by-at-home-dining-2021-10-07/">prepackaged food</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cost-of-construction-in-the-us-to-increase-by-0-75-1-percent-says-beroe-inc-301353999.html">houses</a>, <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/91251-rare-earth-metal-prices-explode-may-lead-increased.html">phones and PCs and anything else that needs lithium</a>—even <a href="https://www.confectionerynews.com/Article/2021/09/16/Price-hike-in-raw-materials-causes-headache-for-German-confectionery">German sweets</a>.<br></p><p><strong>2. Shipping goods</strong><br></p><p>Remember that 600% increase in the cost of shipping containers from the beginning of this article? Two main forces are driving that increase. First, as <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/08/business/shipping-containers/index.html">CNN explains</a>, there’s a physical shortage of containers.<br></p><p>Shipping lines shut down when the pandemic hit and canceled sailings back to China, leaving empty boxes stranded in places like Europe and the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Then there’s also a spike in demand for goods, also thanks to the pandemic.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Consumers are clamoring for goods like furniture, electronics, and clothing, much of which is produced in Asia, and with limited container supply, logistics companies can charge much more for their space.<br></p><p><strong>3. Last-mile logistics / delivery of goods</strong><br></p><p>Even if you could get the raw materials to make your products offshore, and pay the shipping costs to bring them onshore, you’d still have to deal with figuring out how to get them into your customers’ hands.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Fedex, the USPS, and UPS are all increasing their shipping costs and their estimated delivery times, reports <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fedex-ups-rate-rises-are-making-online-shopping-more-expensive-11632173409"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, to better deal with higher demand and their own supply chain issues (from higher fuel costs to a labor shortage).&nbsp;<br></p><p>“People who have really invested heavily in their last mile have seen the benefit,” says Ian, who says he’s seen brands successfully use shuttered retail spaces as distribution or local pickup centers for buy online, pick up in store options.&nbsp;</p><h1>Choices facing retailers<br></h1><p>If you’re a retailer, you have two main choices for dealing with your broken supply chain: fixing it or accepting it.<br></p><p>Web Smith, founder of media and eCommerce publisher and consultancy <a href="https://2pml.com/">2PM</a>, notes that not everyone selling product online will be able to get into the nitty-gritty of their supply chain.<br></p><p>“There are a lot of marketing companies, and very few digitally native brands,” he explains. “If you are an eCommerce company that actually understands your products, it’s not that much of a quantum leap to begin figuring out how to get product over.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>He references Lori Coulter, co-founder and CEO at SUMMERSALT: “That woman knows every single thing about every piece of goods leaving the factory.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you have that level of understanding over your supply chain, Web says you might have success switching to air freight, buying a container, or partnering with another company who manufactures in the same area to go in on a container together.<br></p><p>But if you’re in bucket number two—if you’ve accepted that, as Ian says, “There’s really nothing you can do to address your supply chain at the moment”—it’s time to look for creative ways to meet customer demand.<br></p><p>Writing off this entire holiday season isn’t going to help you make it through the next few months. Same goes for the next few years, as pandemic- and climate change-related forces keep changing how the world demands, produces, and sells goods.<br></p><p>“You need to ask what you’re going to do that’s creative and tactical to try and continue to bring in cash revenue,” says Ian.&nbsp;<br></p><h1>6 creative ways to deal with supply chain issues<br></h1><p><strong>1. Stock third-party products</strong><br></p><p>Web, who used to work for the athletic gear company Rogue, mentions their approach to stocking product—which includes goods made by brands like Nike, Adidas, and Reebok along with their own branded goods—as a potential lifeline for eComm brands.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“You can stock similar goods that are appreciated by your customer base that are available,” he says. “The risk is whether you’ll be able to generate demand for those products, and whether you can compete in paid advertising around those products.”<br></p><p><strong>2. Embrace gift cards</strong><br></p><p>What happens when a customer is browsing your site and sees that a product is out of stock? Maybe you get their contact info so you can reach out when it’s back. But what if you could secure the sale now?<br></p><p>That’s the idea behind <a href="https://govalo.com/">Govalo</a>, a Shopify app that streamlines giftcarding on the eCommerce platform.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61685d4d76ce1aec961f1156_LeLS53eahn1fRfrbvCK1E1m4q2utAuGPInX2_QRG9lYTV1PMVFfn0Iwp5YCThJmKz3tQCPlTKZ-eXBjyMxYe7BFGTZxJQiS2KlKzADhQauIshLSD8S0RZDWLusNtTVuX2JnJxaZT%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><em>This photo comes from this </em><a href="https://twitter.com/OrchidBertelsen/status/1445038792713199622"><em>tweet</em></a><em> about Govalo’s launch this week—and shows exactly how the gifting tool integrates into product pages.</em><br></p><p>Giving customers the option to purchase gift cards allows them to still give a coveted holiday gift even in the face of supply chain nightmares. Save Christmas and your bottom line? What’s not to love?<br></p><p>“Gift cards are like a zero-interest loan,” says Ian. “If more merchants can push gift cards, that’s really a good play.”<br></p><p><strong>3. Explore delayed fulfillment and shipping<br></strong></p><p>Delivery by December 24: expensive. Delivery sometime in Q1 of 2022: enjoy 25% off!<br></p><p>Ian hasn’t seen those options pop up yet, but he expects he will soon. “Brands offering increasingly higher discounts based on delayed shipping options would be really cool,” he says. “There’s a whole slew of deferred revenue issues in terms of how you’re managing your finances, but I definitely think it’s going to be out there.”<br></p><p>Web agrees: “You can incentive customers to spend by telling them they pay a little bit less if we can deliver really, really late.”<br></p><p>It may not work with people who are shopping for others, but for anyone buying their own gifts this holiday season, offering discounts can help smooth out the kinks in a backed-up supply chain.<br></p><p><strong>4. Offer additional value for already-purchased products</strong><br></p><p>We already know that <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/10-ways-for-retailers-to-improve-customer-lifetime-value-ltv-clv">customer lifetime value</a> is <em>the</em> metric for eComm retailers to chase. It’s more lucrative—and meaningful—to have a long-term relationship with customers than it is to be constantly sprinting to bring new ones in the door.<br></p><p>So how are you keeping your long-term customers happy this holiday season? Especially if they have to deal with product and shipping delays they haven’t experienced before?<br></p><p>You can add additional value with <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-product-protection-increases-customer-ltv-and-drives-loyalty">product protection plans</a>, for one. Clyde’s plans come with repair options so that your customers don’t have to wait for new replacements that may take months circumnavigating the global in the current supply chain mess. They can now get those products, covered under a warranty plan, repaired by reliable professionals.</p><p><strong>5. Rethink how you communicate with customers</strong><br></p><p>Despite the supply chain articles that keep popping up in mainstream publications, you’ll still run into consumers who have no idea what’s going on and why it’s taking so long to get the new gaming system their kid expects to see on Christmas.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s on you to gently educate them on what’s going on.<br></p><p>“Good brands have to be more forthright and proactive in letting the customers know to expect delays—and in having great customer service to deal with them,” says Ian.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Along those lines, he expects to see changes to customer-facing copy (like websites with banners explaining supply chain issues) as well as an overhaul of how customer success is set up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Customer service is not just the phone anymore. It’s happening across social media. We call shopping in your DMs "conversational commerce," and it’s the same thing as conversational customer service,” says Ian. “Whether it’s via chat, Instagram, Twitter DMs, or Facebook Messager, what was in the past reserved for a social media manager is going to be more customer-service facing.”<br></p><p><strong>6.

6 eCommerce Trends for 2021	6-ecommerce-trends-for-2021	6 eCommerce Trends for 2021	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6001a973b31931b608146087_eCommerce%20Artwork%20-%20Option%201.png	<p>2020 changed the way the world studies, works, communicates—and the way it shops.<br></p><p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/">TechCrunch reported</a>, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated consumers shift to eCommerce by around five years. It sped up market saturation, demanded continued innovation, and, for certain categories and types of merchants, massively boosted sales. All of that change feels like an “unprecedented” event, and that’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/unprecedented-named-peoples-choice-2020-word-year-dictionary/story?id=74735664#:~:text=After%20Dictionary.com%20named%20%22pandemic,2020%20Word%20of%20the%20Year.">how we all keep describing it</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But while we may not have predicted these changes to the global markets in the wake of the pandemic, we have seen "innovation bursts" before. The Industrial Revolution, for starters, was fueled by technological advancements and the loosening of economic and legal restrictions; the “Great Leap Forward,” was driven by the advancements in education and skills post-World War II; even the recent rise of the PC and the changes it brought to communication, productivity, and everyday life serves as another example of rapid innovation.<br></p><p>Non-incremental changes. Disruptions. Massive shifts in production, sales strategy, and consumer expectations—they've happened before and they'll happen again. The question is, "What will those changes look like in 2021 and how can merchants prepare?" Here are the six e-commerce trends we expect to see in 2021.<br></p><h3><strong>Trend 1: Free shipping isn’t enough</strong><br></h3><p>This trend is a two-parter.<br></p><p>First, offering free shipping is no longer a differentiator. A <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-study-says-more-online-shoppers-want-free-shipping">National Retail Federation report found</a> that customers are increasingly expecting free delivery of online orders, with 75% of consumers demanding it and nearly 30% backing out of a purchase because two-day shipping wasn’t free.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Call it the Amazon effect if you wish, but it exists. During a pandemic year of brown cardboard boxes showing up on front porches and in apartment lobbies like clockwork, consumers have only come to expect that shipping is easy and free.<br></p><p>Second, merchants can no longer differentiate themselves with free shipping, which means that they’re getting creative on the "customer experience" side of things. From the growing popularity of <a href="https://medium.com/brandtrepreneur/unboxing-the-trend-anyone-launching-a-product-needs-to-know-f0c15e1df04c">unboxing videos</a>, which provide companies with highly valuable social marketing and virality potential to dynamic and downright pretty packaging, brands have a chance to lean in and capture valuable audience attention and free word-of-mouth advertising with well-designed packaging.<br></p><p>Beyoncé’s Ivy Park line led the way in viral unboxing in 2021, with the bright-orange wardrobe boxes received—and immediately posted about—by celebrities, influencers, and activists:<br></p><div></div><p><br></p><p>You don’t need Beyoncé money to make a splash—cute, colorful packaging is enough to get everyday consumers excited, like for the thousands of people excited to post their bright-green HelloFresh boxes each week:<br></p><div></div><p>‍<br></p><h3><strong>Trend 2: Higher consumer expectations for creativity and branding&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>If I were to tell you about a new B2C startup selling literally anything—be it exercise tools, or shampoo, or sunglasses—what do you think their branding would look like? If you guessed soft, pastel colors, sans-serif fonts, a proliferation of houseplants, clean lines, and minimalistic ad campaigns, you’ve nailed it. Call it <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/27/16029512/sans-serif-lifestyle-font">the minimalistic aesthetic of lifestyle startups </a>or simply the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/will-the-millennial-aesthetic-ever-end.html">millennial aesthetic</a>, but one thing is clear: the same fonts, color schemes and product designs are growing stale and alienating consumers who are sick of looking at glossy branding and wondering if the product beneath it is worth their money.<br></p><p>That’s especially important since <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirimasters/2020/06/10/cpg-brands-see-potential-in-non-amazon-marketplaces/?sh=4a4d894960b4">consumers are increasingly going to marketplaces</a> like Amazon, Instacart, Walmart, and eBay to do their shopping. Instead of buyers going to a brand directly to choose their purchases, they’re going to the digital equivalent of the mall, where all products compete directly against their competitors, meaning that branding is one of their only chances to stand out.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Even the CIA is drawing heat for being part of the flashy-new-branding-but-no-better-product-or-culture crew:<br></p><div></div><p>That’s not to say that it’s impossible to move the needle with branding, though.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Haus’ locally-made apértifs and the luxe-but-real brand they’ve built around themselves is getting lots of love, proving that it’s possible to have a sleek aesthetic but still come across as authentic:<br></p><div></div><h3>‍<br><strong>Trend 3: More competition from big players that were traditionally focused on retail markets</strong><br></h3><p>Fast-fashion giant <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zara-to-close-1-200-stores-as-it-outlines-post-coronavirus-future-11591794618#:~:text=Zara%2Downer%20Inditex%20SA%20ITX,out%20its%20post%2Dpandemic%20future.">Zara closed 1,200 stores</a>, but that doesn’t mean they’re not selling to those markets. Inditex, which owns Zara, told the WSJ that it’s closing stores where they think they can successfully shift sales online, with a plan to recoup the profit lost by the closings.<br></p><p>That might be a great thing for consumers, who can now get funkily-cut sweaters from the comfort of their own home, but it represents a huge shift in competition for smaller retailers. As big brands like Zara are pouring money into improving their e-commerce offerings, from doubling down on UX integrations, restructuring pages in line with SEO best practices, and launching digital marketing campaigns, smaller merchants will have to keep innovating to stay alive. After all, Zara alone is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zara-inditex-invests-in-online-shopping-post-pandemic-2020-6">investing $1 billion</a> into its e-commerce platform in the next three years.&nbsp;<br></p><p>An example of how smaller brands can stay competitive is Equal Parts. With <a href="https://www.criteo.com/blog/qa-le-creuset/">Le Creuset barreling into e-commerce</a> after 94 years of wholesale success, how does a smaller cookware competitor stay relevant? <a href="https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/food/a29688411/equal-parts-cooking-expert-text-service-review/">With a text-based culinary coach</a> that comes for free with a cookware purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:25%"><div><img alt="Equal Parts Will Make You Cook at Home with Its Text-Based Coaching Service" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6001a99d9a3243805cc3ad53_UEhS-jlcm0midxvRz49j5BNkJqsYdxOlQ79e0aG8y27gBvE4dS95RBdqrMZ95h5OqhPY9e7Wd7L2TCApaxWpI0jXtng4ORGa92_fsyRDmTBIPXCBi0yxeCYACP9euD4VPR8RokYl.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h3><strong>Trend 4: Customer service and support is more important than ever</strong><br></h3><p>With <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/three-ways-to-combat-rising-customer-acquisition-costs">customer acquisition costs</a> rising faster than you or I can say AdWords, it’s vital that when a company does manage to win a new customer, they keep them.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Not to mention the outsized risk of bad experiences spreading through social media posts and online reviews that could taint your brand and ruin your shot of successfully upselling a customer.<br></p><p>Per <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Customer_Support_Specialist/Salary">Payscale</a>, salaries for experienced customer support professionals are trending upwards, and the increased importance of offering a great customer experience should only see those numbers rise.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On a related note, we also expect to see the importance of understanding the customer experience to impact other departments, with CS team members taking on outsized roles in teaching other employees about who their customers really are (including the proliferation of rotational programs). Gainsight, which makes customer success software, wrote in their <a href="https://www.gainsight.com/guides/the-essential-guide-to-customer-success/">Guide to Customer Success</a> that CS is the driving force behind innovation. CS teams help their product teams know what tools users really want and need. They assist the marketing team by helping them bring in the right kinds of leads, which ultimately helps sales effectively position their product and hone their pitch.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In 2021, brands in every industry will offer loyalty programs and other incentives to keep customers happy and plugged in to their product evolution.<br></p><h3><strong>Trend 5: Resale niches will keep growing, driven by eco-consumerism</strong><br></h3><p>With skyrocketing unemployment and growing consciousness of environmental issues, including those plaguing the fashion industry, what’s a stylish consumer to do?<br></p><p>Well, turn to the luxury resale market. The well-known consignment site The RealReal <a href="https://www.papermag.com/realreal-resale-report-2020-2647088008.html?rebelltitem=9#rebelltitem9">saw a 27% increase in consignors</a> in the second half of 2020, even as buyers were steering clear of officewear and instead buying gently-used loungewear, sunglasses, and silk scarves.<br></p><p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/used-tech-and-gadget-repair-businesses-are-booming-right-now-46531abf4bbc">OneZero reported</a> that the demand for refurbished tech products skyrocketed last year, thanks to its ability to provide functional equipment without the sticker stock of brand-new tech, while an inability to buy (or even source, with supply-chain interruptions) new tech made people more interested in repairing what they already have.<br></p><p>We expect to see all the refurbished and resale markets explode across all eCommerce niches, with more and more brands running their own program versus losing those sales to other marketplaces.<br></p><h3><strong>Trend 6: Advertising landscape is shifting</strong><br></h3><p>Remember the memes about every single tech company deciding its platform needed a version of in-the-moment disappearing images and videos? First there was Snapchat, built around the concept, then Instagram followed suit, and then everyone else fell in line, from Facebook to Pinterest to YouTube to even LinkedIn?<br></p><p>Here’s a meme to jog your memory:<br></p><div></div><p>Pick your poison between TikTok, IGTV, Reels, Fleets and the other dozens of options, sure, but you’ve got to pick at least one. &nbsp;TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat all topped <a href="https://www.kantar.com/campaigns/media-reactions">data consulting company Kantar’s 2020 report</a> on media effectiveness, beating out traditional online advertising destinations like YouTube and Facebook. The report highlights "gamified" media formats, like brand-sponsored hashtag challenges, that drive the positive customer experience of ads on TikTok.&nbsp;<br></p><p>New channels are coming on the scene, too, from smart TVs to in-app purchasing options across the messaging app of your choice. Marketing departments will have to expand beyond the classics of email and text marketing to stay current and to reach their intended audience where they are.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>In summary: It’s a brave new world</strong><br></h3><p>And we’re all here trying to figure it out. Who knows what the social unrest, pandemic, and political instability of 2021 will look like over the coming months, or how the rest of the shifts in the eCommerce market will play out. What we do know is that innovation continually rewrites the future, and that we expect these six trends to play a part in the coming story.<br></p><p><br></p>	Fri Jan 15 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

If you run a B2B business of any sort, I bet you could draw that blue-cloud logo from memory. You’ve probably used Salesforce to nurture prospects, service customers, and track sales.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But the software giant has brought its customer relations expertise to the world of eCommerce for B2C sellers with its digital commerce platform, Commerce Cloud Digital.<br></p><p>And while that platform offers key features—like managing multiple sites, campaigns, AI integration with their Einstein integration, and access to retail experts—it doesn’t do everything.<br></p><p>Enter Salesforce’s AppExchange and its <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/mktcollections/cloud-collections/commercecloud">hundreds of available apps and integrations for Commerce Cloud</a>.<br></p><p>We’ve done the work of highlighting 6 essential Salesforce Commerce Cloud apps for any business.<br></p><p>These are the 6 apps and integrations you need to make your ecommerce business run smoothly and produce results.<br></p><p>This guide will highlight several key categories and the best product on offer in each, then explain how it works, what it costs, and where to get it.<br></p><h2><strong>Ratings and reviews management: Yotpo</strong><br></h2><p>92% of consumers look at reviews before they buy, per a <a href="https://bizrateinsights.com/resources/shopper-survey-report-the-impact-reviews-have-on-consumers-purchase-decisions/">2019 Bizrate Insights study</a>. They’re one of the only ways to get a sense of whether the product they’re considering will meet their needs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can have the nicest photos and the best-written copy in the world, but buyers want to hear from real, live people like themselves to see how something stacks up against their expectations. (And they understand and even look for some of those reviews to be negative. Products with ratings of 4.0-4.7 sell better than products with ratings higher than 4.7, per <a href="https://spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/online-reviews/">Northwestern</a>.)<br></p><p><strong>Yotpo</strong> is one of the best ways to do that.<br></p><p><strong>What it does:</strong> <br></p><ul><li>Sends automatic requests to customers to leave a review</li><li>Allows you to moderate reviews and respond directly to them</li><li>Integrates product star ratings with a selection of on-site widgets</li><li>Customize basic integrations to fit your brand’s style and voice</li><li>Provides reviews analytics on key KPIs<br></li></ul><p><strong>What it costs:</strong><br></p><ul><li>Free for up to 50 monthly orders with the above features</li><li>Need a quote from them for premium accounts that offer extra features like in-depth widgets, advanced customization, and a dedicated partner<br></li></ul><p><strong>Where to get it:</strong><br></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/yotpo/">https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/yotpo/</a><br></li></ul><h2><strong>Email and SMS marketing: Klaviyo</strong><br></h2><p>Forget direct mail, online display ads, and paid search ads—email marketing is the <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64614-email-remains-the-best-digital-channel-for-roi/">best bang for buck</a> when it comes to promoting your products, and SMS marketing is quickly making gains, too.<br></p><p>Enter <strong>Klaviyo</strong>.</p><p>What it does:&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li>Builds an email list with well-integrated popups and forms</li><li>Automatically updates your email list with demographic data to use to personalize campaigns</li><li>Directly handles client responses to campaigns with pre-set messaging flows<br></li></ul><p>What it costs:<br></p><ul><li>Free for up an email list of 250 and up to 50 texts</li><li>Depends on size of email list + number of texts sent. $20/month for 251-500 contacts, for instance.<br></li></ul><p>Where to get it:<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/klaviyo/">https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/klaviyo/<br><br></a></li></ul><h2><strong>Marketplace and catalogue management: Mirakl</strong><br></h2><p>Amazon became the eCommerce behemoth that it is today because it figured out how to create an online version of a very in-person experience: marketplace shopping.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Instead of browsing the aisles of a superstore, popping into different shops in the mall, or waltzing through a market, you can go onto Amazon and get dish soap, a pair of shoes, the latest gaming console, specialty light bulbs, and half a dozen other things all at once.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Not every Salesforce Cloud Commerce store will need to or want to become a marketplace, but for those that see the opportunity in doing so, <strong>Mirakl</strong> is your best bet. And if you plan to stay a one-seller shop for a while, you can still utilize Mirkal’s catalogue features.<br></p><p><strong>What it does: </strong><br></p><ul><li>Easily onboards multiple sellers to your site</li><li>Controls the quality of third-party vendors and ensures they meet your customers’ expectations</li><li>Manages catalogues and product listings (useful for all sellers, including those without marketplaces)<br></li></ul><p><strong>What it costs:</strong><br></p><ul><li>No free trial</li><li>Ask for a quote&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Where to get it:</strong><br></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/mirakl/">https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/mirakl/</a></li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Seamless checkout management: Bolt</strong><br></h2><p>Customers want the checkout process to be fast and painless, and when it’s not, there are consequences: <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">over 70% of shoppers abandon carts when shopping online</a>, and 85% of shoppers do the same on mobile.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Fixing that looks like providing one-click checkouts where everything is handled on one page—with no slow load times or extra fields to fill in.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But to achieve that, many ecommerce companies have to rely on a dozen different tools: payment processing apps, fraud detection programs, and shipping calculations, among others.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Using an optimized checkout partner allows vendors to create a seamless checkout experience for customers that’s easy to manage on the backend.<br></p><p>That’s exactly the idea behind <strong>Bolt</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>What it does:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Checks for payment fraud and offers 100% protection</li><li>Creates a one-step, one-page checkout experience&nbsp;</li><li>Optimizes checkout for mobile with no-scroll walkthrough</li><li>Integrates with payment options like Apple Pay and Stripe<br></li></ul><p><strong>What it costs:</strong><br></p><ul><li>Per-transaction fees that depend on your business; you’ll need to ask for a quote&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><strong>Where to get it:</strong><br></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/bolt/">https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/bolt/</a></li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>Payment plan options: Affirm</strong><br></h2><p>Shoppers like options.

It’s worth noting that I’ve called out “Extended Warranty” in the title of this article, but there’s a difference between an Extended Warranty (a policy that <em data-w-id="bda94519-f85e-a527-3ece-659e77e446da">extends</em> the lifetime of the manufacturer’s limited warranty) and a Product Protection Plan (a policy that typically covers Accidental Damage from Handling, or “ADH”). Both Extended Warranties and Product Protection Plans are available to retailers who use Clyde. For the sake of this article, we’ll refer to the combination of these two offerings as an “Extended Warranty Program.”<br data-w-id="0118684b-020f-c3ad-424f-f4bf1e1aeb8a"></p><h2 data-w-id="9e40e334-d9cd-a0b5-d641-15a271c101ef"><strong data-w-id="6f87436c-a893-693f-55c5-053865ea6ea7">Why Some Businesses Mistakenly Choose to Opt Out</strong></h2><p data-w-id="c65e3b99-9d1d-42a4-dd9c-cbcd609d87e2">Given unlimited resources, most retailers would choose to implement an Extended Warranty Program, but typically de-prioritize this kind of program due to a few usual suspects:<br data-w-id="4238efe1-3cde-c5d4-a085-a20f827cd71d"></p><h3 data-w-id="6667d25e-2cd3-8c72-4dda-702e3c887784">They are resource intensive: </h3><p data-w-id="bce7633d-0736-20ad-99b6-e81e32488672">Extended Warranty Programs have been traditionally resource intensive. If the retailer is large enough to partner with an independent claims administrator or with an insurer directly, there are numerous steps involved in implementing and maintaining such a program, not limited to: cost negotiations, operational flow design and optimization, catalog and contract matching, performance adjustments, programming offerings into the website, and maintenance of any of these items). Managing these tasks typically takes a team of people.</p><h3 data-w-id="8c01b68c-85e2-1baa-7ee1-712aa3abcc33">They are complex: </h3><p data-w-id="f1ab8dbf-39ab-3b72-0822-f818c6d2e56d">If it’s your first time establishing a traditional extended warranty program, there’s a lot to learn. Although extended warranties are not insurance instruments, they are still heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels.</p><h3 data-w-id="500a4c19-6d6e-8cdc-8f2e-14bb4c8a5f0f">Underestimates of the financial impact: </h3><p data-w-id="ae726718-6f26-0289-dde0-59d0086235b0">When most business leaders (probably such as yourself) think “Extended Warranty Program”, they don’t typically think “Now that...<em data-w-id="af53c0d5-a6af-c87b-6505-cce9785ff99d">that</em> is a Big Money win!” The fact is that it’s a completely new concept that Extended Warranty Programs are an accessible option for all businesses - from SMBs to Enterprise. As a result, the financial impact to a business savvy enough to implement one is (though often overlooked) actually quite significant. Maybe even “Big Money.”</p><h1 data-w-id="230f06be-a2ba-6d4f-b66a-b4d8d175b988"><strong data-w-id="15a00a35-9e30-e16b-362b-afecdada678b">7 Things to Consider when Evaluating an Extended Warranty Program</strong></h1><h2 data-w-id="0ea9f37f-bb4f-b2ee-f475-6477c7e950be"><strong data-w-id="50eaa3b9-a0f4-18b9-e350-4231919d1e62">1.

Extended warranty CTA best practice is to clearly offer additional “product protection”. “Extended Warranty” is so yesterday.<br data-w-id="9603c239-e066-634f-2c10-b37a2d3be16f"><br data-w-id="a1b055a8-22a6-74a2-0d76-57d291a38e3e"></p><figure data-w-id="70c73b40-6d78-89a7-ee3d-6bc41622b1cf" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1600px" style="max-width:1600px"><div data-w-id="6699829e-94fd-85a3-60c9-bc68995d77f2"><img data-w-id="fea47ffd-4415-12a3-4c4b-74fc229cf7b5" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cf900d560beba3f3d9ed018_hiyW2xAQ22PfjZjqRl2TsS9cPpw4-mKbZ3AjzBZgOEdNOBPvCly-A7AirdFEqIIahZ3O-KqRbPKd42iB2SEesu2OsPEbnpxEgssYklE1vf_ilPbjwRGxP5W1MZjQxIIq-8HFBLlE.png"></div><figcaption data-w-id="b50d3be5-d23f-74e7-615d-63f8d43d2be3">Amazon Protection - Product Page Representation</figcaption></figure><figure data-w-id="432c8044-e7ed-d1b8-653c-46451644c7d7" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1423px" style="max-width:1423px"><div data-w-id="d2aa87cb-1a1f-4d25-a216-45e80b637c50"><img data-w-id="f3f54078-0200-6771-2385-62996cbf7694" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cf900edd3117d81ac4b3928_tKLLlPWARgX5a_iS5HzLOkuFu3h7q1S3fGuxycK8Z9bOwK0MFXaZmincbS2sGqq6SlFHMKUrKj-iRVpOYmzmPeEStRGrhGJImSwt70PhSL2UKHAqKBIPF5PY_dBsK54EtjJa2xQv.png"></div><figcaption data-w-id="943a6653-fa8b-0e85-d258-3c8d82d0b61b">Clyde Protection - Product Page Representation</figcaption></figure><h2 data-w-id="8387869f-b104-5759-7085-289ba6fc57e8"><strong data-w-id="22dfe96c-dd9a-a29c-b081-bb8251643149">3. Ease of Use</strong></h2><p data-w-id="04c06247-31f2-7c42-e43e-68ff133341c9">If you’re considering working with an insurance provider or claims administrator, ask for a thorough demonstration of their warranty program management software. Adequate software should be easily able to integrate into your current systems. The most important integration is the matching of the correct types of extended warranty contracts and terms with your existing product catalog, as well as cart-product and order-product functionality. The software should also offer built-in tools like super users, user management, performance analytics, EW markup management, EW sold contract details, and category, subcategory, and individual product customizations. <br data-w-id="bdb07b73-c058-a850-0963-8d7998cfdeef"></p><p data-w-id="ee35fd9a-48ad-a588-31f9-c668b6571fb9">In the absence of a sufficient software platform, you and your team will need to complete each of the tasks above manually.</p><h2 data-w-id="51b2e6c3-c8d8-ec27-af2d-3d950c279198"><strong data-w-id="e2cef95a-2e28-7cf7-37b5-1b1d1b9487d6">4. Legal Compliance</strong></h2><p data-w-id="eb880b89-812c-eb47-08d6-0822f157d565">Extended Warranties are still heavily regulated at both the federal and state levels. We cover a <a data-w-id="6c736ab3-cab1-9068-c3c7-a67c42ac64c7" href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/brief-history-of-product-protection" data-rt-link-type="external">brief history on product protection here</a>, where you can read more about the <a data-w-id="c3f77478-8f49-6f23-f182-e07e5e589b95" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2009-title15/html/USCODE-2009-title15-chap50.htm" data-rt-link-type="external">Magnuson-Moss Warranty – Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act</a> and other important legislative developments for extended warranties.

Flexibility</strong></h2><p data-w-id="8db871d7-08c8-a1e8-c5a6-e0f853fb57b4">Nobody likes to be locked into long-term contracts or exclusivity clauses. When evaluating solution providers, ask about how many insurers they represent and if they have any exclusivity clauses. Ask about what courses of action you have if customer service levels need improvement. The right Extended Warranty Program should leave you with the flexibility to swiftly make changes that are right for your business.<br data-w-id="bcbc0bfc-46cf-fdef-4a40-88fa4c539c41"></p><h2 data-w-id="c5a9d88b-ebeb-0eba-71b0-24416b339438"><strong data-w-id="83990986-6c65-61df-7bd9-9e046454a8fa">6. Breadth of Coverage</strong></h2><p data-w-id="086fe8e0-ebcb-e474-df67-e5378e010a2d">Make sure that whatever solution providers you’re evaluating have experience and previous examples of covering your specific type of products. Certain insurance providers specialize more in some areas than others - such as furniture, jewelry, or consumer electronics. Although most insurers will provide custom underwriting if the opportunity (your revenue) is large enough, you should still evaluate their network of service centers, as well as any other retailers they are currently servicing in that category.<br data-w-id="983f5ee7-9474-d7d5-2b1a-ef661fbab6c5"></p><h2 data-w-id="04b67e09-ef68-4208-60a2-ff5f2a3d9074"><strong data-w-id="db4771f9-6c94-e6ab-6e81-3eef6345e014">7. Price</strong></h2><p data-w-id="975fff69-9345-f998-adb2-2d0ce3053c59">Last, but certainly not least, is price. Make sure the prices offered for extended warranties are competitive. If you’re unable to apply 25-50% of a markup on the prices you receive and stay price-competitive, your costs are most likely too high. Keep in mind that the most significant revenue effect of selling an extended warranty is securing the customer’s second sale should the product fail (which is 20% of the time).<br data-w-id="27c1f0e9-e2a1-5b17-b8f3-c6c801496846"></p>	Thu Jun 06 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	james-godwin

Clemsen is a D1 school and CWR is a D3, so they never go head-to-head.<br></p><p>That’s not how it works in eCommerce.<br></p><p>It doesn’t matter if you have the largest advertising budget to ever exist (cough, cough, hi Amazon and your <a href="https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/amazon-biggest-advertiser-earth-adspend-hits-11bn/1672723">$11 billion</a> [!!] spend) or if you’re a small retailer selling on Shopify. You’re competing in the same market for the same customer dollars.<br></p><p>eComm brands and online retailers need to differentiate themselves from their competition using any means possible. Massive stacks of money could be one of those means, but it’s not a particularly practical one. Your pockets are probably far shallower than those of Amazon, Walmart, Target, and other giants in the space.<br></p><p>So it’s time to get creative. To, as we reviewed in <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-smaller-retailers-compete-against-amazon-with-great-customer-experience">this piece on competing with Amazon</a>, lean into your relative strengths—like great customer service, unique product offerings, and thoughtful touches—to stand out.<br></p><p>Here are 7 places to start:</p><h2>1) Create Product Differences From Other Online Competitors</h2><p>You know the Daft Punk song “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger”? It may as well be the anthem for product differentiation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you’re going to compete on the strength of your offerings, you’ll want to make sure customers know that they’re getting the superlative version of what they’re shopping for: a product that’s more efficient, more durable, more reliable, or better performing than any other option. Show them they’re getting the best watch or hiking boot or blender out there.</p><h3>Benefits of Product Differentiation</h3><ul><li><em>Does let you actually compete with the major sellers, since buyers looking for the very best don’t care where it comes from</em></li><li>Makes for strong marketing pushes&nbsp;</li><li>Helps with SEO and page rank by name-dropping competitors and showing how you outperform them</li></ul><h3>Challenges of Product Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Often doesn’t last long. If your product actually is better, your competitors will catch up and copy you to the maximum extent allowed by patent law. (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015">Amazon famously copied well-performing products</a>, made their own versions, and then boosted their versions in search results.)</li><li>Expensive to create</li></ul><h2>2) Customer Success and Service Differentiation</h2><p>The majority of your customers may never need customer success or service. Or at least not anything out of the ordinary. They’ll make their order, get their package, and maybe be asked to fill out a NPS survey or to leave a review. That’s it.</p><p>But what about when something goes wrong? When a customer has a question, or has run into a problem with a product, or needs to make a return, or is unhappy with their purchase?</p><p>If your company can make those experiences easy and enjoyable, you’ll stand out from the crowd.&nbsp;</p><h3>Benefits of Success and Service Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Creates genuine brand advocates (people love sharing their opinions, and they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dangingiss/2019/04/10/consumers-are-more-willing-to-share-positive-experiences-than-negative-ones/?sh=25ef3e826a49">share more positive than negative experiences</a>)</li><li>Allows for flexibility in how you achieve it: you can be faster, more responsive to customer feedback, available on more channels, more empathetic, and more creative in solutions</li><li>Provides valuable customer feedback to product team to continue to improve what you offer</li></ul><h3>Challenges of Success and Service Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Requires staffing up a solid customer success / service team (and not outsourcing it)</li><li>Runs the risks of customers taking advantage of your commitment to delighting them&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>3) Provide More Distribution Channels and More Access</h2><p>Some of your customers may shop on social. Others might like to make purchases from marketplaces, so they can see all their options at once. Still others could prefer to physically see items before they buy.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As an eComm retailer,&nbsp; can’t be everywhere, but the more places you are, the more potential customers you’ll be able to connect with. For example, if you sell headphones, you could differentiate your business by having those headphones available for sale in the most places possible: on your own website; on a major music label’s website via a partnership; on Instagram via a purchase button; on shelves at a record store; at a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman">pop-up event</a> in a key market, and more.</p><h3>Benefits of Distribution Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Makes it extremely difficult for competitors to copy your approach</li><li>Lets you tap into markets you otherwise wouldn’t have the resources to deeply understand and market to</li></ul><h3>Challenges of Distribution Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Requires lots of coordination between internal sales and marketing teams and external partners, vendors, and other retailers to pull off</li><li>Introduces messaging risks that distributors or other retailers will misrepresent your brand</li></ul><h2>4) Build Better Relationships As Effective Differentiation</h2><p>Okay, so you’ve got an interested customer, or even one who’s made a purchase from you. What happens next?</p><p>Do you get to know who that customer really is? A differentiation approach that focuses on relationship-building would be screaming for you to say YES.&nbsp;</p><p>A high-touch relationship management model, where you call customers to check in on their orders, invite them to exclusive in-person or virtual events, and ask the to participate in paid product focus groups, for example, allows you to showcase how thoughtful, courteous, reliable, and helpful your employees (and then, by definition, your brand) is.</p><h3>Benefits of Relational Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Makes your brand values really come alive and increase your credibility&nbsp;</li><li>Creates long-lasting customer loyalty</li><li><a href="https://smallbiz.tools/importance-building-customer-relationships/">Boosts employee morale</a> by making them proud of the work they do&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Challenges of Relational Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Takes a lot of time to build&nbsp;</li><li>Introduces key person risk, if your best sales, customer success, service, and UX people leave&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>5) Use Branding and Reputation To Stand Out From the Competition</h2><p>A customer who is in the market for hiking gear has a staggering amount of retailers to choose from: REI. The North Face. Marmot. Columbia. Kuhl. Arch’teryx. Icebreaker. Osprey. Black Diamond. Patagonia.<br></p><p>But a customer who is in the market for hiking gear that is specifically made in environmentally-friendly ways by a company who shares their values really only has a few options from that initial list available. And if they want that company to actually use their platform to pressure governments to protect the environment? Well, they’ve narrowed it down to one: Patagonia.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The privately-held company <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/070715/success-patagonias-marketing-strategy.asp">famously puts its money where its values are</a> by doing things like asking customers to buy used gear instead of new, using solar energy at its headquarters, and donating its tax cuts to climate-related efforts.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Your brand can enjoy the same kind of differentiation by defining your key values—the things you want to stand for—and making sure your branding reflects it. Customers who share your beliefs will go out of their way to shop with you instead of your competition.&nbsp;</p><h3>Benefits of Reputation Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Creates <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-future-of-influencer-marketing-is-here-6-trends-from-territorys-rafael-schwarz">microinfluencers</a> who are happy to share their support of your company because it represents their values</li><li>Centers your marketing and advertising decisions around a common set of key messages</li></ul><h3>Challenges of Reputation Differentiation</h3><ul><li>Can alienate lots of would-be customers who don’t agree with your approach</li><li>Puts you at risk of distracting yourself from creating great products (or can seem that way to detractors)</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>6) Utilizing Your Prices As Your Differentiator</h2><p>“But I can’t beat Amazon’s prices!” you say as soon as you read this heading.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Yes, that’s probably true, which is why price differentiation is number 6 on this list instead of number 1. It’s not the most realistic for many eComm vendors. <em>But</em>! You can compete on price without racing to the bottom. It just requires you to get creative.<br></p><p>Instead of offering the single-lowest price on a given product, for example, you can offer competitive pricing on a bundle that includes that good.

And, when done right, something that customers can be awfully big fans of, too.<br></p><p>I saw a masterful upseller in action the other day. I was getting my makeup done at a beauty store before a wedding, and as I sat in the chair while a professional applied creams and powders to my face, I listened to her coworker consistently double her sales.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Customers would come up to the register with their items—a few sunscreens, an eye serum, or a specialty shampoo—and the saleswoman would ring them up and then say one simple line: “Do you know about our promotion to get $25 off?”<br></p><p>She’d go on to explain it: customers who spent more than $100 would get a voucher for $25 off that would be good on any purchases made in the following month. It was a one-two upselling punch, since not only was she driving up her average order values (AOVs) because people were going from a $60 basket to a $105 one, but she was all but guaranteed they’d be back the next month to buy more.<br></p><p>Upselling is a key part of any sales plan, but if you’re an eCommerce retailer, you have to be extra strategic about how you do it. You have no register to station friendly salespeople behind, so how are you making sure that your website is optimized for those opportunities?<br></p><p>Here, we’ll show you eight examples of companies that are doing just that.</p><h2>Upselling vs Cross-selling</h2><h3>What is Upselling?</h3><p>Upselling is when you persuade a customer to upgrade their product in some way, or to buy more of it.&nbsp;</p><h4>One of The Best Upselling Examples on the Web</h4><p>If you’re buying a smartphone and get served with a pop-up that asks if you want to go for the model with additional storage (and that comes as an additional cost), that’s the vendor trying to upsell.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Apple does this really, really well:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61142809252dd54f46430cd6_k8HSilrwrOQ4OSrCTMF0P4DdM0Iz-9rtFmgGnSPgnm3bjhbCQK6jqLh2JwbDzbW5MlWw8guURBArcAqYduro-MSxPY64_WJfnySet3ND7yENXcXYhk3g8TqIqyRsreBlb9UZa5zV.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>While the iPhone 12 is advertised as “from $999,” it’s presented with three storage options, two of which drive up the price.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61142809fca254a0f07967f6_XJ68GLcWA5Po03mAmM44_TKevn-4QdY-F0_5-BnDyHI93aOps87soQueOjRCpOUh_Etd-_8XuEkPdiVml052hP5hYnYr5Mi0-jU1HsHtUMSp-QPXwWEoaDM6u0Nk25YWKRmLZEqa.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Apple then asks if you want AppleCare, their warranty program, which is another way of upgrading your product.</p><h3>What is Cross-selling?<br></h3><p>Cross-selling is when you persuade a customer to buy items that are somehow relevant or related to other things they’ve bought.</p><h4>One of The Best Upselling Examples on the Web</h4><p>Apple again.

Make Sure Your Upsell Recommendations Are Tailored To Each Customer</h3><p>Upselling isn’t all about the upside—being too aggressive about it can actually hurt your sales in the end. A <a href="https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ni-Jian-01-19-2017-CarRental_2015.pdf">2015 study</a> done at Wharton found that when sales agents are overly focused on upselling, they can double their success rate, but also that the odds of their customers choosing their company in the future will decrease by 5.5%.&nbsp;<br></p><p>One of the best ways to make sure your upsell recommendations are helpful vs. harmful is to make sure they’re for products or services you know your customers are interested in. Don’t try to sell your most expensive product to everyone who comes across your site—focus on the ones you think will actually want it.&nbsp;</p><h4>Example: How Samsung Targets Upsells</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280af7f10b28e6710588_538spxLQ4QgAXuXl7-aCunB1K9Kow--yWYysKkVNbCCsbAMLOirElpdEqpSy4U2TncRarWQbaNH5NznaO3WUEgJMLAMzvtDJXsDmFYqqK83cqyn35_4wVxTsqKLgW26P-8Nz6JgY.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>After selecting a 50” Samsung Smart TV, customers are immediately presented with the option to upgrade their TV size for just a few hundred dollars more. It’s reasonable to assume that customers who want a 50” might go for a 55”, too, and the way that it’s presented isn’t in-your-face and aggressive.<br></p><h3>2. Implement Product Warranties and Protection</h3><p>Just like in the AppleCare example from the intro, adding product warranties and protection plans are a great way to upsell your customers. Not only are you offering them something helpful and providing a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-smaller-retailers-compete-against-amazon-with-great-customer-experience">better customer experience</a>, but you’re doing it in a way that <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/increasing-margin-and-aov">increases your margin and AOV</a> with no additional overhead.</p><h4>Example: How Barnes and Nobles Drives Upsells with Clyde</h4><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61142809f27ac26dbe79e3ac_V0ILAVC3cCwjNARqoM1WWvT-XGtzBpTF07vDTRucRac7A2znQZtzG30UD2uqW9SEUWwnZAiPungjVrEolsKbxPCGc4nE7HATpRE2VKVVO0kQosJXF89kEnnuAtx135q1kYrLmvR2.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Purchases of B&amp;N’s Nook e-readers are offered a chance to add on a protection plan covered by <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Clyde</a> before checking out.

Use Free Shipping To Upsell Your Customers</h3><p>Upselling is all about getting your customers to upgrade their current purchase. An easy way to incentivize them to do that is to give them a target to clear for some kind of payoff. Free shipping is an example of a payoff that’s fairly simple to implement—and one that’s pretty much required in a competitive market—that still has a big influence on customers. (<a href="https://martech.org/e-commerce-report-9-10-consumers-say-free-shipping-no-1-incentive-shop-online/">9 out of 10 consumers</a> say free shipping is their top incentive to shop online more!)<br></p><h4>Example: How Sephora Increases Upsells with Free Shipping Countdowns</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280950f1e62b91b5a321_cdPDvY9TLoEjd2HrnEkadhIrWwVPCiKLiUisoyAY7wnMnXzAEUAUB-ofDGrmpnnUpbmFXpGA3t1zlH9BDcEBtCp2Z6GkiQep24EU8AtGtoGNOBfvjSrOWgMpZXWHo92zFolwFi-p.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Sephora’s eComm platform offers free shipping once a customer reaches $50. This $15 sunscreen doesn’t meet that cutoff—but the shopping card prompt reminds the customer that they’re “only $35 away from Free Shipping.”</p><h3>4. Offer Substitutes or Alternatives for Out-of-Stock Items</h3><p>If a customer is already looking at your products, you’ve nearly made it to the magical 15% (that statistic about how many prospects actually become paying customers). Don’t lose them by being out of stock on the item they’re looking for!<br></p><p>Offering a swap—particularly for a more expensive item—is a great way to keep a customer’s business <em>and</em> potentially get an upsell out of them.</p><h4>Example: How KitchenAid Upsells with Product Replacements</h4><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280a34e7e8513ae66fdf_cZ8Xwsp4Ei3QwFB_uNX4ihEg0BitET_4BicKuoiMDivks7pSESaywYnZUyL3JOSNGqFZmxDt2oDp0dqRJ8gNKMC45gy7tKM9Xe37zV6YBhw1nuGTb_gXAA6l9afrD-2g9uok1Ukj.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>This is masterful upselling for three reasons. First, the “recommendations” bar loads live on the site as soon as it recognizes that the item a buyer is looking at is out of stock. Second, it’s gentle—asking “Have you considered these?”, which is unlikely to offend a customer or make them feel like they’re experiencing a bait-and-switch. And third, the two actual swaps for the item are more expensive models (from $199.99 to $299.99 and $429.99, respectively—ignore that bowl, that’s not a swap and it’s unclear why it’s even there!). If a buyer did switch, KitchenAid would be enjoying a significant upsell.<br></p><h3>5. Send the Upsell Through A Follow-Up Email</h3><p>On-site upsell opportunities aren’t to be underestimated, but a well-designed email upsell can work, too. Transactional emails are a vendor’s <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">touchpoint trojan horse</a>—they’re the emails consumers are most likely to actually open (versus automatically delete).&nbsp;<br></p><p>By adding upsell opportunities to transactional emails like order confirmations, shipping notifications, or satisfaction surveys, you’ll increase the chance that a consumer will consider shelling out a little more to upgrade their already-purchased item or to add on a more expensive product or service in addition.&nbsp;</p><h4>Example: How United Airlines Upsells with Confirmation Emails</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280a75e6dcd8d96c9dc9_gMyZfuGbTJV1v4XjJ7CQ2xa50ACvaZeCf1tuqLMi2GCelNfQdpNHa1MxqcpD0XlRGyoXHQtk8Eg10XVTD3hJay748Up98B9pAPiHvIuJySf8_TL1GM0MLFdkUPRgtC7KNY1a8H3g.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>In an email confirming a flight purchase, United gives their customers several additional purchase options. The chance to get a good deal on a rental car or a hotel are classic cross-selling opportunities, and the option to “select your seat”—for an additional charge, of course—is an upsell.<br></p><h3>6. Bundle Products to Upsell Them Together</h3><p>If you want a consumer to choose a more expensive version of an item, you can incentivize them by making it feel like a deal to do so. That can look like offering $20 or 10% off of a purchase order if you buy a whole set, or throwing in an additional upgrade for free when at least one upgrade is already purchased. Making it seem like there’s a lot to be gained from spending just a little more can often push buyers in the direction of an upsell.</p><h4>Example: How Mono Upsells Luggage with Bundles</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280a6ee8597a585195a0_UlbawVFVR8aZ_pYTFfnxEX5Jlv6nXV1uyxdAK6oYZRMsTP_uMM-E-o5RacGXps0t-mM6JbcSg1len48PVzvhbtpsjFZiRFI4SENQP1PmaDqivoNsjeVDXGdvhkg_78kkvJ4swqBS.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Luggage company Mono could sell their Carry-On Pro Plus—already a great example of an upsell, since it’s more expensive than their regular carry-on, carry-on plus, and carry-on pro—alone, but by offering it as a set with other luggage, like their check-in medium, it encourages buyers to upgrade their purchase even further. (This one’s a bit of a cross-sell and upsell mixed together, but it works!)<br></p><h3>7. Offer Price Choices</h3><p>Customers like choice, and like feeling like they’re getting a deal. “<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/anchoring.asp">Price anchoring</a>” is a technical term for when you set a benchmark of how much something <em>should</em> or <em>usually</em> costs, then offer a kind of deal that lowers that pricing, making buyers think they’re getting something special.<br></p><p>It works well with subscription plans or service plans when you want to incentivize customers to buy more. You can upsell to them by showing them that if they’re willing to commit to a longer-term plan, they’re actually getting more for their money.</p><h4>Example: How Birchbox Upsells Subscriptions with Price Choices</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280a7ff4f7883a319827_cM0ppCZew-X1U-CGRDPRE5YlSPbJqr5GQ210HFe2SKstfs8E75-pUDZebKN224PHHEtVs4QDopU9bajkZd9kBah0IdmuFzgzC42JWU9a9tnEJbapbwgJOWNZnaRkLmjpLeFEbqU2.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>This is a great upsell because Birchbox isn’t actually even offering a change in price for their first two tiers of subscriptions! Sometimes even an illusion of choice is enough. Customers can get one month’s worth for $15...or three months’ worth for $45, at the exact same price. If they’ll commit to a whole 12 months, though, they’ll get a $2/discount per month (a ~13% discount!).<br></p><h3>8. Use Social Proof to Encourage Upsell&nbsp;</h3><p>Social proof, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/social-proof/">per Neil Patel</a>, is the idea that we want what other people have. A busy restaurant is more appealing than an empty one, for instance.<br></p><p>The same principle works for eCommerce, too—brands and products that other people seem to like will naturally appeal to consumers, who want to feel like they’re not alone in making a purchase and in fact are following in the footsteps of peers they respect.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Social proof and upselling can be as simple as adding banners to popular products and as complicated as showing specific reviews to consumers you think are highly likely to be interested in a product upgrade.</p><h4>Example: How iRobot Upsells With Social Proof</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280a4c1f54857cc21411_v149UljihHu5gGyu8Tie26373GeYn3qVZKgus2fKoGFA9_X-IRp01QZ55EF9FzDbOVWGZMJz9x_bA_11gyhzzTyWj_B_dq50mI_qrLHnpeWT0TvxJJI5QFIjjJK5NQXjfl_3GdZk.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>When a buyer clicks on the “Roomba v9+ robot vacuum,” priced at $1,099.99 on iRobot’s homepage, they’re brought to a product page that immediately pivots them towards a more popular model—that just so happens to be more expensive, too. The “best seller” tag subtly cues buyers to shell out for the upgrade, securing an upsell through social proof.</p><h3>Combine Multiple Upselling Strategies</h3><p>There’s no rule that says you have to limit yourself to just one of these upselling strategies. In fact, trying several different ones, all throughout your site, can increase average order values while also giving you valuable data on what’s working best with your target audience.</p><p><br></p><h4>Example: How Xero Uses Social Proof and Price Choices to Upsell</h4><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6114280adfdb914dfccc7ebe_9FaUkkapemoqbWkyLCL5zE2Aoi_tRELXgtPTE4WaSOJbicHdV8Zi8nlVr_x1f18WKyRDzCJgj_DAVpq8IXZRRbyz3XYsS_VAbFJu7r3_9ykQWxlbwXmcbqXX9GtYz7perI0Y4qh2.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Accounting software Xero offers a variety of price choices while also pointing out which is most popular (turns out that’s a more-expensive plan, of course!). This is one example of combining different upsell strategies—which will you choose?</p><h2>Let Clyde Help You Upsell To Your Customers</h2><p>If you’re not yet offering a purchase protection plan to your customers, it’s worth considering one—they can increase <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/increasing-margin-and-aov">AOV</a> while also improving customer experience and loyalty. <strong>To learn how Clyde makes upselling easy, </strong><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect"><strong>schedule a demo today</strong></a><strong>!&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p>	Wed Aug 11 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

They want more personalization, more sustainable packaging, more beautiful packaging, more dependable shipping, and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/next-wave-customer-service-expectations">more timely and direct customer service</a>.<br></p><p>That’s a lot to deal with. If keeping customers is a challenge in an average year, 2021 upped the stakes. For companies dealing with product delays, increased competition, and ever-growing customer expectations all at the same time, retaining customers couldn’t be more important.<br></p><p>Or lucrative.<br></p><p>A <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers"><em>Harvard Business School</em> report</a> dug into <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/three-ways-to-combat-rising-customer-acquisition-costs">customer acquisition</a> studies across industries and found that it can cost <strong>anywhere from 5-25x more to get a new customer than to retain an existing one</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And that keeping <strong>5% more of your customers </strong>can <strong>increase profits by 25-95%</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But before you can improve your customer retention rate, you need to know what it is.&nbsp;</p><p>eCommerce teams who <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-democratizing-data-drives-ecommerce-teams-forward">democratize their data</a> and use it to drive improvements in customer experiences are the ones who will stand out. Do you know your numbers? Do you know what numbers you should even be measuring?</p><p>Read on for our guide to the TK retention metrics that matter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding customer churn vs customer retention</h2><p>Let’s say you’re a direct-to-consumer dishware company. You want people to keep buying your dishware whenever you come out with a new line, or a new product, or your customers’ dishware needs change. A dishware company will have different expectations for customer retention than, say, a diamond company or a dog food company. (Diamonds being something that doesn’t often get bought, and dog food being something that does; that’s why comparative customer retention rates really need to be benchmarked by industry to be useful.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>If our hypothetical dishware company found out exactly how many customers are returning to do business with them, they would have found their <strong>customer retention rate.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>If they instead found out how many customers they’ve lost over the same period, they’d be looking at their <strong>customer churn rate</strong>. Both are important, and they’re clearly related. Fixing the issues that drive churn can help increase retention, for instance. Understanding what drives retention helps you maintain it.<br></p><p>How to measure the top metric: customer retention</p><p>Calculating customer retention is pretty simple.<br></p><p>You’ll start with <strong>your number of total customers</strong>, then <strong>subtract the number of recently-acquired customers</strong> and <strong>divide by your number of returning customers</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s important to do this on a reasonable time frame. How quickly does it usually take for you to onboard and successfully deliver goods or services to your customers? Do they often churn out within a week or month or six months? Choose a time frame that’s right for your industry.<br></p><p>Let’s say our dishware company measures their return rate on an annual basis, since their customers don’t buy dishware more than once or twice a year. Their formula might look like this:<br></p><p><em>(6,000 customers at the end of the year) - (500 new customers acquired since the beginning of the year) / (7,000 customers at the start of the year) = 79% retention rate</em></p><h2>8 Other Key Customer Retention Metrics and KPIs Worth Tracking</h2><p>Customer retention rate is a great headline number for wake up and stare at every morning. It’s like the <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/a-deep-dive-on-net-promoter-score">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</a> of retention metrics. But there are others worth knowing, too, including:<br></p><ol><li>Customer Lifetime Value<br></li></ol><p>How much is a given dishware-buying customer worth to your company over time? Customer lifetime value, or CLV, drives the long-term success of a business.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>Start with your customer’s <strong>average purchase size</strong> and multiply it by <strong>the number of purchases they make per year</strong> and <strong>the number of years they stay a customer</strong>.<br></p><p>Our dishware company might calculate theirs like:<br></p><p><em>($200 AOV) x (2 purchases per year) x (4 years average customer relationship) = $1,600 CLV</em></p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><p>Clyde users tend to be obsessed about their customer experience—it’s why they wanted to offer peace-of-mind-granting extended warranty programs in the first place—so we’ve seen lots of ways to <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/10-ways-for-retailers-to-improve-customer-lifetime-value-ltv-clv">increase your customer lifetime value</a>. Here are a few to start with:<br></p><ul><li>Regularly solicit customer feedback, like with an automatic review platform, and prioritize improvements based on any negative feedback</li><li>Provide value to your customers outside of your direct product, like with educational or inspirational materials or media&nbsp;</li><li>Resolve issues quickly via a dedicated customer success team</li><li>Introduce <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/8-upselling-examples-and-tips-that-increase-order-values">upselling</a> and cross-selling into your checkout process</li></ul><p>‍<br></p><ol start="2"><li>Customer Acquisition Cost<br></li></ol><p>How much money does it cost your company to successfully get a new customer?&nbsp;</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>This one needs marketing department involvement. You’ll take the <strong>total marketing cost</strong>, which will be made up of <strong>salaries / wages </strong>paid to your marketing team and any consultants that you have on board; <strong>tool costs </strong>for any email services, CRMs, ad platforms, and other marketing tools used; and <strong>advertising spend</strong>, which will include traditional, digital, and any other kind of advertising or publicity projects — and then <strong>divide it by the number of customers acquired</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our dishware company would calculate theirs by taking:<br></p><p><em>($250k salaries for 3-person marketing team + $100k in consultant services) + ($22,000 annual cost of tools and software) + ($100k advertising budget) / (500 new customers acquired) = $944 CAC</em></p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><p>Spend less money acquiring customers. Sounds easy, right? You can <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/three-ways-to-combat-rising-customer-acquisition-costs">combat rising CAC</a>s by:</p><ul><li>Implement a referral program to unlock an army of (free!) <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-future-of-influencer-marketing-is-here-6-trends-from-territorys-rafael-schwarz">microinfluencers</a> that drive acquisition without driving spend</li><li>Cut your advertising budget and focus instead on the one or two platforms that best perform for your specific business, as explored in <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/paid-social-media">HubSpot’s great guide</a></li><li>Automate manual (read: expensive) marketing tasks, like formatting emails, so you can streamline your team over time&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><ol start="3"><li>Value to cost ratio / LTV:CAC&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>Once you know exactly how much a customer is worth to your business over time and exactly how much it costs to bring said customer into the door, you can get to a really important metric for the health of your business: your value to cost ratio.<br></p><p>If your value to cost ratio is less than 1, it means you’re losing money to acquire customers. You’re spending more than they’ll end up being worth, and that’s not at all sustainable.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If it’s just above 1, you’re slightly profitable, but not close enough to the growth levels needed to make a real difference.<br></p><p>If that ratio is between 2 and 3, well done. 3 is the benchmark many industries look for, since it means you’re making more than enough revenue to keep acquiring at your current pace or to even improve it.<br></p><p>If your ratio is above 3...you’re absolutely crushing it and are on track for big thing$. Kudos!</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>This one is simple: just <strong>divide your LTV by your CAC</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Based on our dishware company example:<br></p><p><em>(LTV of $1,600) / (CAC of $944) = 1.7</em><br></p><p>That’s a decent value to cost ratio, but our company needs to get its LTV up or its CAC down over time if we really want to stick around and enjoy <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/increasing-margin-and-aov">growing margins over time</a>.</p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><p>This really just requires working on the driving forces for both of those two main metrics! Keep in mind that sometimes improving something like LTV means thinking outside of the box to provide a service, an option, or an experience that customers cannot get somewhere else. For instance, take this example from a successful DTC <a href="https://twitter.com/eliweisss/status/1457767703918358529">beverage company’s thread</a> on how they grew their subscriptions:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61bcbea1a2d81b42737a34b8_gB6hnqrpkEDbL_B-DNoDwfgfviwxeN0e0fCGHur1NN3rLIssImTwpnIA4MaCq2hQhVo75bjDjHyciXyD5B0nfzWHES02U2Av9nAJ_DqvDdfDaBOGdn7AMd-aR6DYbNfaLpNo8w7F.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><ol start="4"><li>Revenue churn rate<br></li></ol><p>This metric lets you know what percentage of revenue you’ve lost from your existing customers over a given period, and it puts a number to the scale of the annoyances or disappointments faced by your customer base. Revenue churn can be driven by cancellations, returns, or the end of a buying relationship, and digging into it can help you get ahead of issues.</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>Take your <strong>regularly recurring revenue at the beginning</strong> of a period, like a month, and <strong>subtract</strong> your <strong>regularly recurring revenue at the end of the month</strong>, then <strong>divide by your start-of-period number</strong>.<br></p><p>Our dishware company might see a RCR of:<br></p><p><em>(start of month MRR of $200,000) - (end of month MRR x $210,000) / ($200,000) = -5%</em><br></p><p>In this example, having a negative revenue churn rate means that you’ve made more new money from existing customers than you have lost it. If you released a new product and then saw your RCR spike, though, you’d know that that product wasn’t performing with your core customer base—and that you needed to intervene.</p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><p>Revenue churn rates work best for companies who want to drill into specific product offerings. (Measuring it across an entire company’s product line often isn’t that helpful, since you can’t identify what products are driving changes.) If you don’t like your RCR, consider:</p><ul><li>Focus groups to test out new products before launch, including marketing messaging around them</li><li>Post-churn surveys to understand why a customer left&nbsp;</li></ul><p>‍</p><ol start="5"><li>Customer churn rate&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>This number is the percentage of customers you’ve lost during a given period, oftentimes a month. It’s different from revenue churn rate as it looks not at how much money you’re bringing in, but how many people are buying from you. You could see a spike in customer churn (you’re losing customers) even if you see no problems with your revenue churn (you’re still making the same or more money per month), especially if you did something like release a new, more expensive product line that was of no interest to one segment of your customer base, but got other existing companies to spend more money per order.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>Take your <strong>number of customers at the start of the period</strong>, and <strong>subtract your number of customers at the end of the period</strong>, then <strong>divide by that first number</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our dishware company might see a customer churn rate of:<br></p><p><em>(6,000 customers at start) - (5,800 customers at end) / (6,000 customers at start) = 3%</em></p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><p>A 3% customer churn rate isn’t bad at all. A <a href="https://rocketmarketinggroup.com/churn-rate-by-industry/">marketing consultancy found</a> that average churn rates vary by industry, but fall between 5-7%, with rates spiking in consumer goods, at 9.6%, and falling in SaaS, at 4.8%. But if you see your customer churn rate hit more than 8%, you’ll want to understand what’s driving it and:</p><ul><li>Redesign key processes, like checkout or returns, around customer feedback</li><li>Offer more timely customer assistance, from live chat to phone to email ticket service</li><li>Revisit your pricing, especially if you’ve recently considered an increase</li></ul><p><br></p><ol start="6"><li>Product return rate<br></li></ol><p>This number applies only to companies that sell physical things, like our dear dishware company. It measures what percentage of units sold end up being returned.</p><p><br></p><p>Returns can be driven by a variety of factors, including dissatisfaction, fit or quality issues, or product failures. (In that last case, if you offer an extended warranty program, you can actually <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/building-loyalty-with-newly-acquired-customers">build customer loyalty</a> even in the case of a product failure and capture the next sale.) Understanding what’s behind your customers’ returns will help you improve your customer retention over time.</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>This is a simple one: take your <strong>number of units returned </strong>and <strong>divide it by the total number of units sold</strong>. Just make sure you’re looking at both numbers over the same timeframe, like month, quarter, or year.<br></p><p>Our dishware company might see a product return rate of:<br></p><p><em>(150 units returned) / (4,000 units sold) = 3.8%</em></p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><p>A <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/ecommerce-returns">2021 Shopify report</a> looking at eCommerce returns found that online purchases are returned around 11% of the time, with apparel coming in at one of the highest rates (12.2%) and pharmacy purchases at the lowest (1.6%). Around 10% of returns are driven by defective or “not as described” products, says the report. And January is peak season for returns, driven by post-holiday shopping fallout.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To get ahead of those trends, companies can:</p><ul><li>Make product information easier to find and more accurate. For apparel, this can include using different-sized models and sharing their specific dimensions; for electronics, it can include comparative photos and commonly asked questions, for instance.&nbsp;</li><li>Use augmented reality technology to let customers “try out” products before they buy, like a Shopify example client who build 3D versions of their dog crates so customers could check out the sizing on the crates before buying, which ended up cutting their return rate by 5%</li><li>Improve your packing and shipping processes, from using inventory management software to make sure you don’t sell out-of-stock items to adding an extra inspection step to catch damaged product before it goes out the door</li></ul><p><br></p><ol start="7"><li>Repeat purchase ratio<br></li></ol><p>This metric measures the percentage of your customers who return to buy from your company again—and is often a quick at-a-glance way to check your customer loyalty. This number can be especially helpful when broken up by demographics across your different buyer personas.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Maybe under-30s regularly come back to buy more from our dishware company, but older people don’t, so our email marketing campaigns focused on completing your set should really be dedicated to that younger subset.</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>Take your <strong>number of returning customers</strong> and <strong>divide it by your number of total customers</strong>. You can do that over any time period, from weekly to annually.<br></p><p>For our dishware company:<br></p><p><em>(1480 returning customers) / (6,000 total customers) = 25%</em></p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Segmentize your marketing efforts by key customer bases</li><li>Make the most of transactional emails (including <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-a-post-purchase-email">post-purchase emails</a>!)</li><li>Offer incentives for a second purchase, like a free gift or a discount</li><li>Go even farther and launch a loyalty program with action-based rewards for repeat buyers</li><li>Try cart abandonment emails that encourage people to pull the trigger on a new purchase</li></ul><p><br></p><ol start="8"><li>Time between purchase<br></li></ol><p>This number lets you know how long it takes a customer to return to buy from you again. It gives you useful data on their appetite for their product (as well as how happy they are with it), along with letting you know the right cadence to use for marketing pushes to re-hook them for future purchases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keep in mind that this metric, like many others on this list, depends entirely on your industry. If you sell a monthly subscription box, your expectation is likely that happy customers would come back every month to buy another. If customers are waiting 8 months to get a second one, well, either you’ve misjudged their use for or interest in your product, or they’re unhappy with the price / quantity / quality. If you sell expensive leather boots, it would be unreasonable to expect people to buy a new pair from you every month, and a once-every-two-years purchase rate might be exactly what you’re looking for.</p><h4>How to calculate it</h4><p>Measure (using a CRM, likely) each customer’s <strong>individual purchase rate</strong>, or how long it takes them to purchase another item after purchasing their first. Then <strong>divide the sum of individual purchase rates by your total number of repeat customers</strong> to find the average.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For our dishware company:<br></p><p><em>(68 days + 92 days + 127 days + 105 days + 99 days +...[1475 other individual time between purchase numbers]) / 1480 repeat customers = 98.2 days between purchases</em></p><h4>Tips for improving it&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Send custom email campaigns, like “We miss you!” or “New product we think you’ll like!” emails, utilizing personalization whenever possible</li><li>Use elements of gamification to encourage customers to keep coming back to your products or pages, like letting them unlock discounts for trying a new product line, leaving a review, or posting about their purchase</li><li>Offer off-cycle promotions on the cadence you’d like your time between purchases to be<br></li></ul><h2>Give Customers What They Want With Clyde’s Warranty and Product Protection</h2><p>Happy customers return, and an easy way to make your customers happier across the board is to offer best-in-class purchase protection on every sale.<br></p><p>Clyde’s platform is here to do that.

A Deep Dive on Net Promoter Score	a-deep-dive-on-net-promoter-score	A Deep Dive on Net Promoter Score	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6076e7714aa34367a7661d63_Net%20Promoter%20Artwork%2001.jpg	<p>Southwest Airlines’ is 71. Verizon Fios’s is 24. Airbnb’s is 43, Apple’s is 51, and Ritz Carlton’s is 70.<br></p><p>Those numbers are those companies’ NPSs, or Net Promoter Score, and I can guarantee that the CEOs of those companies think about their number on a regular basis.<br></p><p>Companies in every industry (and over <a href="https://fortune.com/longform/net-promoter-score-fortune-500-customer-satisfaction-metric/">two-thirds of the <em>Fortune</em> 1000</a>) track their Net Promoter Score, a measure of customer loyalty. But different industries see different results. Although Verizon’s NPS is significantly lower than Southwest’s, they both lead their respective industries, per <a href="https://www.satmetrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/net-promoter-score-benchmarks.pdf">Satmetrix’s 2020 report on Net Promoter benchmarks</a>.<br></p><p>Though the methodology behind the NPS is open-source and widely-adopted—all you have to do is ask your customers one question!—there’s an entire sub-industry of customer research firms and software services that exist to help companies gather, analyze, and act on the insights from their NPS.<br></p><p>Like with any metric dependent on customer responses, though, even the highest Net Promoter Scores are only including insight from a small section of a given company’s customer base. The future of the ubiquitous loyalty metric might look a lot less like email surveys and a lot more like AI-enabled predictions.<br></p><p>But more on that later! In this blog, we’ll cover:<br></p><ul><li>What is NPS?</li><li>How is NPS calculated?</li><li>What’s a good NPS?</li><li>How is NPS used?</li><li>And what’s the future of NPS?<br></li></ul><p>And we’ll also do our best to not ever say the phrase “NPS score” (the “score” part is in the name, a la “ATM machine!”). But no promises.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>What is Net Promoter Score (NPS)?</strong><br></h2><p>Net Promoter Score is a customer loyalty and satisfaction metric that measures how likely people are to recommend a company to their friends.<br></p><p>It’s pretty much just that one question: <em>How likely are you to recommend our [company, product, service] to a friend or colleague?</em><br></p><p>Respondents can choose from an 11-point scale ranging from 0, or not at all likely, to 10, or extremely likely.<br></p><p>You’ve probably seen them after buying a product or using a service:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6076e78e851576df410498c6_Df0ezELhOvspMlj9JPGnS0aHgkaqPnBUM7kDpoTg-TP6zA65faflDB9DxbsLmqsYjaJnmbWNngBuPwx8DU1E0vNl-ToUki85zjQ7cskUcJaaZnFkKGcyA3HEVVTdnl8iX1h7DsUI.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Sometimes companies will go beyond that first question and add questions like:<br></p><ul><li>What influenced your rating?</li><li>What could we do better?</li><li>What is your age / gender / location? (Or other demographic questions, if that information isn’t already collected elsewhere.)<br></li></ul><p>The <a href="https://www.netpromoter.com/know/">Net Promoter Score</a> was invented by, and is a registered trademark of, Bain &amp; Company, Inc., Fred Reichheld, and Satmetrix Systems, Inc. It was popularized by Reichheld’s 2003 <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article “<a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow">The One Number You Need to Grow</a>,” which argued that NPS was the most helpful indicator for predicting future growth.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>How is NPS calculated?</strong><br></h2><p>A company’s NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Those groups are determined as follows:<br></p><ul><li>If they respond with a 9 or 10, they’re <strong>promoters</strong>, or people who will share your business with others and be recurring customers themselves. These are the most valuable customers to have, loyal and vocal.</li><li>If they respond with a 7 or 8, they’re <strong>passives</strong>, or people who don’t have any major issues with your company but aren’t likely to actively endorse it, either. They’re satisfied but unenthusiastic.</li><li>If they respond with a 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, they’re <strong>detractors</strong>, or people who are unlikely to recommend you to others and may speak negatively about you. They’re damaging to your brand, So if a company surveys their customers and 70% of respondents gave the company a 9 or 10, 10% gave them a 7 or 8, and 20% gave them scores between 0 and 6, the company’s NPS would be 60. (The passive percentage gets left out of the calculation.)&nbsp;<br><br></li></ul><p>To get a score of 100, every single customer would have to be a promoter. The lowest score possible is -100, if every single customer is a detractor.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>What’s a good NPS?</strong><br></h2><p>There’s no one end-all benchmark for NPS; it depends on a company’s industry.<br></p><p>For instance, industries that are full of churn—like internet service providers—enjoy an average NPS of just 1, whereas online entertainment companies see an average score of 43, according to <a href="https://www.satmetrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/net-promoter-score-benchmarks.pdf">Satmetrix’s 2020 report</a>.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6076e78ee9fb3ad4ca0c0c2c_sGM7VlwtcwLvlrVABDp2jI7HQb_s5GZFNEQm3SOVftF-60fQ-L1HTiemr8rngD6Glc4S-WqKhlWLcICYnxCEz9FOKBof6pLgs2D0Lz8Tdza7UR_FtgiAhutQfAjalOW5QJf85Bqb.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Generally, a score over 70 is excellent and means that a company’s customers really love them and are providing tons of word-of-mouth referrals.

A Moving Target: The World Of CTAs	a-moving-target-the-world-of-ctas	A Moving Target: The World Of CTAs	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60953fc14aebaa79c451531d_CTA%20Blog%20Post%201.jpg	<p>Consumer behavior, in an online environment, has been tracked and studied for the better part of the last 25 years. Yet, obtaining comprehensive real-time insights into online consumer behavior remains tricky because variables are constantly changing on both ends of the eCommerce experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Just as companies begin to understand consumer behavior and begin tailoring a user experience that drives higher conversion rates and purchases, consumers pivot and change their behavior. Consumer expectations also drive this back-and-forth, because once customers become accustomed to a new way of online purchasing, they expect uniformity across all their online purchases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If Instacart, for instance, makes upgrades to its app that make it easier to select ingredients for an entire meal, that level of thoughtfulness and customization will soon be expected by their users when they begin shopping for workout equipment or home furnishings. Suffice to say, company innovations and corresponding consumer expectations continually move targets relating to eCommerce data.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60955604c068d8509c106dd6_White%20Yellow%20Red%20Square%20Headphones%20Tech%20Retail%20Medium%20Rectangle%20Ad%20(1).jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>That’s why it’s imperative for companies to partner with an internal or external data science team so they can fully understand their customer data in real-time. Understanding your customers and tailoring an experience that they like and that simultaneously drives higher revenue is the name of the game. We observe this two way-street between consumers and companies in the form of CTA/prompt data every day. Our merchants provide an online experience layered with CTAs with the intent of driving consumers to purchase warranties. Each click generates information, and in aggregate, gives both the merchant and Clyde insight into what drives consumer behavior.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We spoke with our own Monika Heinig about analyzing eCommerce data and how she has helped our customers. Dr. Heinig has a PhD in Mathematics and years of experience leading meaningful data projects. She zeroed in on several key trends that have allowed our customers to increase their attachment rates with the click of a button.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Attach Rate By Prompts</strong><br></h3><p>Across our data, we’ve found a direct correlation between additional CTAs/prompts and attachment rates (“AR”). Specifically, attachment rate doubles on average when an online store increases its prompts from one to two. Enticing more customers to add a protection plan or warranty by doubling your prompts confirmed a commonly held belief that consumers needed to be reminded in multiple locations on the screen or phone that an additional service was available. What was far more interesting however, was that this doubling of attachment rates also held strong for companies making a jump from two to three prompts. A 4x increase in attachment rates by moving from one prompt to three prompts has held steady across our data in the past six months. The returns beyond three prompts appear to plateau and begin to infringe upon a clean and smooth user experience for consumers.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>A 4x increase in attachment rates when moving from one prompt to three prompts has held steady across our data in the past six months. <br></blockquote><h3><strong>Attach Rate Placement</strong><br></h3><p>In addition, our data have been able to determine the most effective location to place a prompt.&nbsp; Locations were broken down into three buckets: cart, modal/pop-up, and product page. Product page has lower success rates compared to attach rates at point of sale. The two-horse race between cart and modal/pop-up proved to be competitive at first glance, but as we aggregated more and more data over time, it became clear that the modal/pop-up option is more effective. Our current customers report nearly twice the AR with modals when offering just a single prompt.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/609553316c5dfcd0dd71d434_Screen%20Shot%202021-05-07%20at%2010.20.27%20AM.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>For eCommerce businesses interested in both maximizing their AR and maintaining a natural user experience devoid of clutter, fields, and pop-ups that slow purchases, our data is instructive. We’ve identified which two prompts, <strong>working in tandem</strong>, produce the highest AR. Naturally, the combination of cart and modal checked in with the highest rate, but it was worth noting that the combination of product page and modal prompts was <strong>66%</strong> more effective than product page and cart prompts when working in tandem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Visuals Matter</strong><br></h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60953fc8d819e86085e3ef37_kDQXEX3t2gIq79DEa4yDjtutuZFBRKUMqMG1Qt0MvsXtR4M4OUEeGN1oFEX7ueAmMok04orVoUSfI2ILBhYDBDjagHtK_4Aud_AVR-wGWHIb9MISh1gqYj5u5z9kem-KhTZ15NgB.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>As a company, Clyde provides our customers with insights into their overall checkout experience. Unsurprisingly, that includes all of the visual variations that impact a consumer's decision-making process. The options to the left may seem fairly similar, but the data has proven that the second option (oriented horizontally) has driven 94% higher ARs than the next highest-rated prompt. The horizontal prompt also achieved the goal of customers selecting the second or third highest priced option more often than any other prompt option.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our design team receives feedback from our customers to continue this refinement process and we’re able to capture consumers’ feedback (in the form of clicks) in real-time. This experimentation that spans visuals, copy, and layout essentially boils down to a try, check, revise methodology.

A New Holiday Shopping Map: The Future of Black Friday	a-new-holiday-shopping-map-the-future-of-black-friday	A New Holiday Shopping Map: The Future of Black Friday	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/611d24eba0ce1d70010cc275_eCommerce%20Weekly%20Update%202%20(2).jpg	<p>“Best Buy has Thanksgiving plans. You’re not invited,” reads a recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/business/best-buy-thanksgiving-closed-2021/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_source=twCNN&utm_content=2021-06-09T19%3A43%3A25&utm_medium=social">CNN headline</a>.</p><p>The big-box retailer will officially be closed on Thanksgiving Day. <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/06/04/walmart-to-close-all-u-s-store-locations-for-thanksgiving-day">Walmart</a> will, too. It’s not quite stop-the-presses news—many stores close on major holidays, after all—but it does represent a major turning point in what the American holiday shopping season looks like.</p><p>In years past, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with the former an in-person sales event traditionally held on the day after Thanksgiving and the latter an online promotion held on the Monday following the holiday weekend, marked the beginning of the holiday shopping season. BFCM, as the two events are known, has historically brought in 20% or more of annual revenue, per the <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/thanksgiving-draws-nearly-190-million-shoppers">National Retail Federation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To capitalize on those strong in-person sales, retailers have been opening earlier and earlier over the last few years, with sellers like Best Buy, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Kohl’s, Target, and Walmart all <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/black-friday-2018-walmart-target-kohls-among-the-retailers-staying-open-on-thanksgiving/">kicking off Black Friday sales</a> on Thanksgiving Day itself in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>2020, with its world-upending pandemic that made in-person shopping dangerous, put a stop to that, and it looks like retailers are doubling down on what they learned last year: the future of retail is omnichannel.</p><p>Black Friday isn’t dead, but it’s certainly different.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, we’ve built you a map of what Black Friday will look like over the next few years—from big trends to specific tips.</p><h3><strong>The product landscape will look different</strong></h3><p>Before we talk about how people are buying, we’ve got to look at <em>what</em> people are buying. And considering the combined impact of a widespread labor shortage and supply chain issues, both due to the pandemic, there will simply be less to buy this holiday season.</p><p>As Rob Garf, Salesforce VP and GM of Retail, told <a href="https://diginomica.com/footfalls-coming-home-christmas-shopping-vaccine-economy-shapes-be-rather-different?utm_campaign=605bcdc747cef400013cdaa7&utm_content=60fe9de1fa0daf0001d634cf&utm_medium=smarpshare&utm_source=linkedin">Diginomica</a> last month:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-clyde-ecommerce-conversation-august-18th" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/611d1982349e20ef2e401e76_eCommerce%20Weekly%20Update%205.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>Stay in-the-know regarding supply chain issues facing retailers by reading our latest eCommerce update.</figcaption></figure><p>“There are fewer workers, raw materials are expensive...that's going to put $12 billion of incremental dollars of costs into the supply chain. But the biggest hit is going to come in logistics. Unlike last year where it was all around the 'last mile', this is around inbound and getting it through the port, particularly here in the States with the Port of LA which has just had a real bottleneck.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ascm.org/ascm-insights/scm-now-impact/supply-chain-trouble-in-toyland/">ASCM agrees</a>, citing those COVID-19 port disruptions as well as flooding in Europe and China that has damaged warehouses, machines, and railways used to transport goods. Whereas previously, toys would have been shipped in July to arrive in August and placed on shelves by October, some toys haven’t even been made yet.</p><p>Hasbro and Mattel are using different sourcers, says the <a href="https://www.ascm.org/ascm-insights/scm-now-impact/supply-chain-trouble-in-toyland/">ASCM report</a>, but even so, they’ll likely have higher prices to pass on to their consumers thanks to skyrocketing shipping costs. You thought having to pay $5.99 on your last online order was bad? Shipping a 40-foot container from China to the States used to cost $2,680 last July. Now it costs $18,346 on average. </p><p>A general rule of thumb to consider? As we enter the second pandemic-influenced holiday season, consumers will understand shipping delays and low product availability, but they’ll still be looking for products that can increase their quality of life and enjoyment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Whether it’s luxury jewelry or a new suitcase for eventual travel, buyers will be looking at not just needs, which occupied much of 2020 shopping, but also wants—they just may have to accept that they’ll take a while to arrive.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Black Friday is now an online shopping holiday</strong></h3><p>Despite stay-at-home orders, widespread layoffs and furloughs, and heightened anxiety about the coronavirus, Black Friday 2020 broke records. Not because people were braving the pandemic to wait in line for doorbusters (though <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2020/11/22/black-friday-when-stores-open-november-28-coronavirus/6269182002/">some did</a>), but because shoppers went online—and spent big.</p><p>Black Friday 2020 was the second-biggest eCommerce spending day in U.S. history (behind only Cyber Monday 2019), <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/black-friday-hits-record-report/story?id=74435965">reports ABC</a>. Consumers spent $9 billion, a 21% increase from the year before.</p><p>Counted in that number, though, are shoppers who bought online to pick up in-store or curbside, which, while technically still qualifying as eCommerce, has a slightly different flavor of it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Omnichannel retail is the future, and retailers who offer flexible options—from buy online, pick up in store to regular eCommerce—will succeed.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><a href="https://eystudios.com/holiday-prep-ebook/?utm_campaign=clyde_Holiday_eBook&utm_medium=email&utm_source=clyde" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61424379553152a30583deb1_.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></a></figure><h3><strong>Online holiday shopping sales are only going to move earlier and earlier&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Black Friday being so big online means that Cyber Monday is no longer the anchor event for eCommerce retailers. Sure, that only drags their marketing forward a few days, but when you think about the fact that <em>all</em> retailers are going to be doing the same thing, it becomes more important than ever that eCommerce sellers have planned out their cadences early.</p><p>(Though don’t write Cyber Monday off: Adobe’s 2020 data shows that conversion rates on CM were slightly higher, at 7.2% for laptops and 3.3% for smartphones, than BF, at 6.8% and 3.1%, respectively.)</p><p>Take a look at the Goliath of eCommerce and how they’re approaching it: a new job posting shows that Amazon is planning an entire role around managing deals, from daily drip campaigns to big pushes around BFCM and Prime Day. It’s not a one-month sprint of their marketing department but rather someone’s full-time job.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/611d250780e7acbb77ba672b_QtAWPWMh_nN6m5MYkKY4fV0PuDXVSPLQ1qQmzCBseGAUOxpaSHlAanrNMQeSoGhs7LssLm6eIEsyKAwgzAFBGDWEklWzWUlNFnH_5vYQ6gXVPnSnFdJy4BDTY6teKMBw6zozjV2W.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Holiday shopping deals will start dropping in late September, early October, and will continue through the end of the year.</p><h3><strong>More ad dollars are moving into digital marketing</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/three-ways-to-combat-rising-customer-acquisition-costs">Customer acquisition costs keep rising</a>, and as big retailers focus more and more on eCommerce sales, that trend will only continue.&nbsp;</p><p>And spending more and more to get new customers just isn’t sustainable.A <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/salesforcecommercecloud/viz/SalesforceShoppingIndex/SalesforceShoppingIndex">Salesforce report</a> featuring data from over a billion shoppers found that the global conversion rate was only 2.4%. Many eCommerce sellers, including many SMBs, just won’t be able to keep up with that spending.</p><p>What might make more sense for them? Focusing on <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/solve-customer-satisfaction-with-customer-experience">improving their current customer satisfaction</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Digital marketing isn’t the only tool in a seller’s arsenal. Great customer service that turns one-off customers into recurring buyers, offerings like product protection that <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-to-grow-average-order-value-post-purchase">drive up AOV</a>, and figuring out new ways to get your products in front of customers—like with <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/livestream-shopping">livestream shopping</a>—can all help you keep old customers and land new ones, without a higher AdWords budget.</p><h3><strong>Owned channels are the future&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-ad-spending-expected-to-rebound-faster-than-previously-forecast-11623666600"><em>WSJ</em> reports</a> that digital ad spending has grown by 26% in 2021 so far. To stand out from that noise, many vendors are moving to focus more on owned marketing, or using their brand channels, from websites to blogs to email lists to SMS campaigns, instead of relying on social or display ads.</p><p><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/sms-marketing-2021">Per eMarketer coverage of Juniper Research and CommerceNext report</a>, global business SMS traffic grew by 10% in 2020, with 51% of retail marketers planning to increase investment in that space over that year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The takeaway:</strong> Email and SMS campaigns have never been more valuable—especially those that go beyond touting promotions to actually add value, whether with gift guides, product reviews, or usage tips.</p><h3><strong>Testing should start now&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Before running big campaigns in September, October, and November, retailers need to be working through the mechanics of their strategies now.</p><p>Which funnels work best for which audience segments? What automation paths have what success? How will campaigns be coordinated across different platforms?</p><p>And importantly, how are you addressing customers’ actual needs through product improvements and custom campaigns?</p><p>For instance, consider a recent eCommerce vendor who decided to launch (and thoroughly test, pre-launch) a password-less checkout experience after they’d surveyed customers and found that a significant percentage of their abandoned carts were caused by buyers not wanting the hassle of having to log in. Doing that research before the holiday season let them address the issues they found with time to spare.</p><p><strong>The takeaway: </strong>Understand where your customers’ pain points are and customize your campaigns and products to address them, using A/B data to refine your approach.</p><h3><strong>We’re facing a perpetual peak season—here are 5 tips on what to do about it</strong></h3><p><strong>1. Plan for SEO early and often</strong></p><p>If you want your product pages to rank for Black Friday or holiday shopping terms, it’s time to start planning now. Confirm your SEO strategy no later than early September, and get to work rolling out product page updates by the end of that month. Make sure you also set a note to go back in post-holidays and update them again with new targeted keywords, whether for 2022 holidays or generic gifting.</p><p><strong>2. Bring together an eCommerce roundtable, if you don’t already have one</strong></p><p>Sales strategies that are created and executed by your marketing team alone are doomed. Why’s that? Because a customer‘s experience of that strategy will involve the work of a bunch of other teams, from customer success to operations to fulfillment.&nbsp;</p><p>If those teams are relatively siloed in your current workflows, ask each group to nominate a representative to meet regularly with other departments to make sure that you’re all aligned on goals and tactics and ready to support each other. Bonus points if you give the group a solid name, like Mission Control or $HQ, and even more points if you find a way to bring strategy and ops employees together, like having your marketing team help pack and ship orders.</p><p><strong>3. Have backups for your backups</strong></p><p>Let’s say your entire marketing strategy for BFCM is based around one major “doorbuster”: a big discount on a TV or watch or basketball hoop, or some other item that you sell that customers are excited about. What will you do when you sell out of that? Especially if you’ve read the writing on the wall, launched sales before BF, and end up selling out in October or early November? You’ll go to your backup plan. Manage your inventory closely and get marketing packages, with everything from product pages to videos to banner ads, ready to launch if you do sell out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Determine your post-BFCM cadences</strong></p><p>Done right, early holiday season sales will bring you a lot of new buyers. Do you know how you’ll turn them from one-time purchasers into long-term customers with <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/10-ways-for-retailers-to-improve-customer-lifetime-value-ltv-clv">high CLVs</a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Try a value-add approach. Telling buyers about purchase protection options in transactional emails can be a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">touchpoint Trojan Horse</a> for building long-term trust. Storytelling, too, like with emails that explain the production of whatever customers have just purchased, or the values behind your brand, can be helpful.</p><p>You can even plan to run a New Year’s campaign around resolutions and the ways that their holiday purchases (and other products) can be used to support lifestyle goals.</p><p>Write those cadences now—future you will be grateful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Get creative with your offers</strong></p><p>If you know you can’t compete with bigger vendors, why not end your holiday promotions before their promotions even start?&nbsp;</p><p>What about offering exclusive free gifts for buyers who give you their phone number (to grow your owned media list)?&nbsp;</p><p>Or going rogue with bold email subject lines? (<a href="https://chamaileon.io/resources/black-friday-email-examples-templates-and-subject-lines/">Here’s some inspiration</a> along those lines, no pun intended.)</p><p>Stay relevant in a crowded landscape with personable, relevant, creative pushes—in November and beyond.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>See you on Black Friday</strong></h3><p>And Cyber Monday, and Cyber Week, and, as we’ve just laid out, probably all fall.<br></p><p>Until then, happy selling—and happy shopping! <br></p>	Wed Aug 18 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
A Startling Shift In Consumer Confidence	a-startling-shift-in-consumer-confidence	A Startling Shift In Consumer Confidence	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fe35a5588f5ab29765b7dca_Clyde_Blog_Exploration_CT_03.png	<p>Merchants across the country have weathered lockdowns, record unemployment and whipsaw movement within the Consumer Confidence Index throughout 2020. In recent weeks, bullish projections for Cyber Week were met with lukewarm returns, but<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/fed-raises-its-economic-outlook-slightly-sees-4point2percent-growth-next-year-and-5percent-unemployment-rate.html"> optimistic projections for economic conditions in Q121</a> began to arrive in the wake of vaccine announcements from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and others. That is what makes yesterday's Consumer Confidence data all the more surprising.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fe359e110de6af955b3c181_EaiYVgmRIhV3hALRpT7kBd8-fv_uRbPjZbSlJnskYdseNl_7kTftRyce55TRPdn3C4_hy4Rfh30sBknRpV2MCK5kcx_6sWR1MEHDVghGhoywdH44woY84bVBlXCBvG_goB5BIU-K.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Both the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index and the Conference Board Index reported slumping consumer confidence data across the month of December. The Conference Board index dropped to 88.6 from a downwardly revised 92.9 in November, according to a report from the group issued on Tuesday. For perspective, economists surveyed by Bloomberg earlier this month had called for an index score of 97. This aligned with Fed projections as well as encouraging employment figures. The Conference Board Index also conducted a survey in which respondents expected their incomes to increase in Q121, improving from a score of 16 to 16.8. Those marginal increases, however, appear to be no match for the dark cloud of COVID concerns hanging over the entire economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;“Consumers’ assessment of current conditions deteriorated sharply in December, as the resurgence of Covid-19 remains a drag on confidence,” Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement on Tuesday.<br></p><h3><strong>Not All Businesses Are Impacted Equally</strong><br></h3><p>Speaking on Tuesday, Franco stated that economic factors are not impacting merchants equally. "As a result (of reduced confidence), consumers' vacation intentions, which had notably improved in October, have retreated. On the flip side, as consumers <strong>continue to hunker down at home</strong>, intentions to purchase <strong>appliances</strong> have risen. Overall, it appears that growth has weakened further in Q4, and consumers do not foresee the economy gaining any significant momentum in early 2021." According to an eCommerce study conducted by <a href="https://ignitevisibility.com/ecommerce-marketing-study/">Ignite Visibility</a>, despite current economic trends,&nbsp; “more than half of consumers plan to spend the same or more this December.” The study also found that companies offering free shipping and a speedy online experience were exponentially more likely to secure a purchase. Sixty-three percent of customers ranked either free shipping or a great website experience as their leading factor when it came to making a purchase decision. Clyde empowers businesses to offer extended warranties and accident protection to their customers, right from their website.

Adapting Digital-First Marketing Funnels to Improve Conversion	adapting-digital-first-marketing-funnels-to-improve-conversion	Adapting Digital-First Marketing Funnels to Improve Conversion	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ed29047241c744e09fbdfaf_Frame%2033.png	<p>While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold globally, companies are navigating uncharted territory as physical stores close (and re-open), supply chains are disrupted, and consumer behaviors are continuously evolving. It has become an era of reckoning for e-commerce businesses that has been made apparent by polarizing impacts across industries — some companies are thriving, while the damage to others is irreversible. With millions of people hunkered down in their homes, the end-to-end, digital-first customer experience has never been more in the spotlight than it is now. What has distinguished the more ‘successful’ companies (thus far) in reaching customers is an unwavering focus on adapting multiple channels across the entire marketing funnel. Although the post-COVID shopping experience is yet to be determined, the proverbial “digital best practices” in retention strategy and conversion rate optimization still apply (and matter more). Companies can continue to improve onsite conversion rates by: (1) leveraging email segmentation capabilities while monitoring ongoing deliverability, (2) communicating clear expectations and surfacing relevant information, and (3) making checkout as seamless as possible.<br></p><h3>Segment email audiences and monitor ongoing deliverability<br></h3><p>Email continues to be a core revenue-driving channel, so leveraging segmentation capabilities while monitoring deliverability can drive valuable traffic to any e-commerce business. Email send volume has increased weekly at roughly 20% since mid-March (vs. pre-COVID benchmarks), <em>and</em> open and click-through rates are growing. Furthermore, most customers are at home and in front of computer screens for longer portions of the day. The increased engagement, even if temporary, means opportunities for audience-specific messaging and more emphasis on healthy deliverability metrics.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With larger than before email audiences regularly checking inboxes, companies have a chance to leverage personalized messaging to segmented audiences. How manual this process is depends on the existing technology stack and data infrastructure, but even demographic or transactional data points in basic setups can help drive traffic and increase conversions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>At the same time, the increased frequency and volume of emails means deliverability is paramount. Maintaining a healthy email program is crucial when nearly all companies are relying on email as a core, revenue-driving channel. The rapid growth in email sends has driven many brands’ emails to end up in spam folders. Companies cannot engage with customers who never received an email in their inbox. If email is the primary communication channel between brands and customers (which for many is the case), brands miss the chance to communicate with an engaged audience. This is even more costly when many of those customers are previous purchasers, and are potentially more likely to convert than other acquisition traffic.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Communicate clear expectations and surface relevant information<br></h3><p>The widespread impact of social distancing on day-to-day living has primed customers to expect changes and disruptions, which in turn creates a unique shopping environment where product offerings, operations, and customer service may also change or be disrupted. Clear and consistent communication is table stakes to confident purchase decisions and promotes a more positive customer experience all around. Surfacing timely information that is relevant to a customer’s experience reinforces brand credibility and increases confidence further down the funnel. Customers may not be pleased with shipping delays, but making a purchase only to wonder why products have not arrived weeks later is a more detrimental customer experience. Moreover, it is uncertain how long business operations will be significantly impacted, so being diligent about regular maintenance is required for the foreseeable future.<br></p><p>This applies beyond operational impacts — with larger digital audiences comes opportunities to provide a more personalized shopping experience. Companies can merchandise landing pages in various ways and tailor the content based on paid and organic traffic sources, technology and resources permitting. Surfacing relevant products and content helps to reduce friction while browsing and consequently increases conversion rates. Even so, this is much easier said than done. In reality, how personalized the experience can be (by audience, traffic source, browsing behavior, or other attributes) is a function of the platforms and tools in place and how feasible it is to make iterative changes against data that may go stale quickly. It may not be possible to create multiple web experiences for many customer segments, but even small tweaks can make a marked impact if one or two behavioral distinctions are identified.<br></p><p>Finding the most effective information or content to show is a challenge, but looking to data can help to identify important trends or issues. Onsite browsing behavior such as increased visits to the FAQ page may point to information gaps, for example. Or, perhaps a spike in particular customer service tickets revealed inconsistencies in shipping communication. In any case, finding suitable proxies in the absence of complete data can certainly jumpstart the process.<br></p><h3>Make checkout as seamless as possible<br></h3><p>Improving the checkout experience is a never ending quest for any e-commerce business, so it should come as no surprise that shifts in customer behavior merit potential shifts in the checkout flow. Simplifying the checkout process by reducing friction, distractions, or the number of steps required allow customers to get to the bottom of the funnel efficiently. Allowing guest checkouts reduces cart abandonment when customers are not required to create accounts prior to completing a purchase (they can be prompted to do so afterwards). Offering a variety of payment options in uncluttered forms makes for a more streamlined experience. Some companies are seeing pronounced differences in mobile versus web as it relates to both browsing and checkout, which may warrant additional adjustment to find what works best. In essence, a vast majority of customers are transacting online and to the extent that process is as user friendly as possible the better.<br></p><p>Customers who have made it to the checkout flow and have almost reached the bottom of the funnel are worth the time and effort especially because they are most likely to convert. Optimizing cart abandonment flows, whether through email or other retargeting channels, will have an outsized impact on driving customers to convert and may not require development resources for significant onsite changes. Though similar to personalized web experiences, not every bell and whistle is feasible (or necessary). Analyzing checkout behavior can aid in prioritizing the most pressing issues and determine the right course of action.<br></p><h3>Looking ahead<br></h3><p>These are certainly unique times, and investments in technology and data infrastructure that support rapid iteration, testing, and personalization are proving valuable. Even as companies look to reestablish a physical presence, many retailers expect online shopping trends to persist. A recent survey of retail leaders revealed that “68% expect [customers] to continue using e-commerce as their primary channel, even if more adopt curbside pick-up and virtual clienteling.” Consumers are simultaneously shaping and adapting to a new landscape of e-commerce and the acceptable ways of shopping across industries and categories. This has ushered in broader adoption of digital-first customer experiences and openness towards changing how customers engage across multiple channels, from email to website to chat to SMS. For marketers, assimilating requires continued focus on digital transformation and finding pockets of opportunity to reinforce customer relationships to build lasting customer loyalty in a truly digital age.</p><p><br></p>	Mon Jun 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	sherri-kuo
Announcing Clyde’s $41MM Series B Funding	announcing-clydes-41mm-series-b-funding	Announcing Clyde’s $41MM Series B Funding	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/616ec5ff32b6755b579e8c05_CLydeSeriesB.png	<h3>To Deliver a Comprehensive Product Lifecycle Platform for Merchants and Their Customers<br></h3><p>I started Clyde because I knew the warranty experience was fundamentally broken for customers and retailers. In 2017, before starting Clyde, I was given the challenge of launching the go-to-market for a new consumer product. We had decided that a warranty program was critical to our strategy — I set off to make that happen. No matter how many calls I made or emails I sent to administrators and underwriters — there was no interest in (or even response to) working with a business of our scale. Then, on my way to a music festival with friends, I bought a tent and was sold on the extended warranty. I immediately lost the receipt, the only thing I had proving I bought the warranty, which I was instructed to keep and to “register” three days later. My experience launching a warranty program, to being a consumer using a warranty, was set up to fail from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>As an individual, I was having the same negative experiences that countless US consumers have endured. Overpriced protection plans, unnecessary registration processes, no transparency on terms and conditions, and lengthy and confusing claims experiences. I had already personally experienced the challenge of launching a program as a retailer, but the consumer experience was really what needed to be completely overhauled. That came first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Today, I am ecstatic to announce that we've raised $41M in new funding, including $25M in Series B funding and $16M in working capital. Stepping back and reflecting on how far we’ve come since the start, I’m humbled by our team’s progress. Seeing how quickly an industry as old as the warranty space could be transformed with new ideas and technology is a testament to the needs of modern retailers and consumers. As we announce our Series B today, it’s clear that the market was not only ready for a solution like Clyde, but is ready for our next leap — to provide a comprehensive product lifecycle platform to both our merchants and their customers.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Why This Series B Unlocks Clyde’s Potential</strong><br></h3><p>We have partnered with more than 300 brands and retailers who trust us to improve their product lifecycle programs. This expansive customer list spans a number of industries and verticals, including consumer and household electronics, scooters and e-bikes, furniture and mattresses, appliances and hardware, fitness and sporting equipment, and jewelry and watch brands. The diversity of the companies we work, by size and vertical, validates that our technology can work for any merchant. Clyde’s extended warranty solution has an average attachment rate of 18%. That metric, over four-times the industry average, has provided us with credibility to expand the conversation we’re having with merchants. I’ve always been incredibly proud of how “product first” Clyde is and today, fueled by our Series B, I’m excited to allude to the larger platform and mission we’re executing on. Stay tuned.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Those conversations are now growing into understanding their products and their customers at a granular level, across a consumer’s entire lifecycle. Fueled by our Series B, Clyde is investing in the expansion of our platform by building tools and functionality inspired directly by our merchants. User-inspired functionality ensures that we’re solving the most pressing issues facing our merchants today, and the funding itself guarantees that we’ll have the resources to deliver.<br></p><h3><strong>Building Momentum</strong><br></h3><p>This funding round was led by Headline, with participation from Vulcan, Spark Capital, Crosslink and other leading investors.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I’m thrilled to report that our team is growing by leaps and bounds and will surpass 100 full time employees by the end of this year, with major team growth planned for 2022. We’ve built a reputation for providing custom and adaptable solutions to our clients and that level of care and thoughtfulness will continue as our team grows. These additional resources will help us expand into new markets and categories, including growing our international footprint.<br></p><p>In 2017 there was a problem in the warranty space — it was inaccessible, impossible to understand. And slow. So slow. Yesterday, Clyde re-imaged what it meant to launch, manage, and find success with a warranty program. Today, we help our partners launch impactful omnichannel lifecycle experiences, funded by the highest performing warranty programs this space has seen.</p><p>‍</p><p>For more coverage on Clyde's Series B, you can read the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211019005085/en/Clyde-Raises-41M-To-Deliver-a-Comprehensive-Product-Lifecycle-Platform-for-Merchants-and-Their-Customers">full press release here</a> and additional media coverage <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2021/10/clyde-extended-product-warranty-platform-brandon-gell/">here</a>. <br></p>	Tue Oct 19 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	brandon-gell
Are Warranties The New One-Day Shipping?	are-warranties-the-new-one-day-shipping	Are Warranties The New One-Day Shipping?	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fbc0669ba44080db5f0a8f1_Are%20Warranties%20The%20New%20One-Day%20Shipping_.png	<p>One of the major economic developments of 2020 has been the acceleration of consumer trends. Consumer spending habits that were once measured quarter-over-quarter are now being reacted to by small businesses week-over-week. External forces ranging from the unemployment rate to the size of federal stimulus packages are depleting the spending power of some demographics while bolstering others. During an analyst call at the end of September, multiple consulting firms confirmed to CNBC that the road to recovery will not be the same for all Americans. “We are going to see groups of consumers recover differently [from the pandemic],” said Rod Sides, a vice chairman at Deloitte and its retail and distribution sector leader. This uneven recovery has created “land grab” opportunities for some sectors, while others are simply fighting for economic survival. When you combine these boom-or-bust conditions with COVID-19 protocols that have impacted in-person shopping, it’s easy to understand why the eCommerce market has become <strong><em>hyper</em></strong><strong><em>competitive</em></strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>An Adaptive Consumer<br></h2><p>A recent survey conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company sought to define American consumer sentiments, behaviors, income, spending, and expectations moving forward into 2021. In terms of spending habits, the survey found that Americans are changing their behaviors in droves, with the following year-over-year increases:<br></p><p>+37% are <strong>more mindful</strong> of where they spend their money</p><p>+37% are looking for ways to <strong>save money </strong>while shopping</p><p>+20% are spending time <strong>researching brand and product choices</strong> before buying</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1434px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fbc06579a543d387ec1a072_kAbLibyUwiNJEoJvrz5W8dCiiBGbluXSjjTuwVI064yo1aEC_ExgBtgcgsT7iBSnG-XzOw_MHMKcqAuUZyuD6sDxqC2CBrR3_hP9f2XOh-mTCWsGxG6BoN1qheCUM5cZppRS-OBi.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br><br></p><p>Additionally, the survey found that COVID-19 protocols and potential lockdowns through Q121 will contribute to a 20%-40% increase in online purchasing across the board. Hybrid offerings like curbside pickup and grocery delivery also skyrocketed this year, indicating that consumers are comfortable <strong>adapting</strong> alongside businesses where there is a premium placed on <strong>convenience</strong> and <strong>speed</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Attracting A Discerning Customer Base<br></h2><p>With discretionary spending tightening and consumers showing a willingness to adapt if it benefits them financially, there may never be a better time to introduce a robust warranty offering. Whether you’re a small business looking to grow your bottomline or hoping to increase the satisfaction levels of your customers, everyone is seeking a <strong><em>competitive advantage</em></strong>. The size and scope of that advantage is usually tethered to its novelty, its cost-saving potential and its ease-of-use.&nbsp;<br></p><p>An example of a competitive advantage that was cultivated over time is Amazon’s two-day shipping program. The company introduced the two-day shipping option in 2005, across a limited inventory of items. Over time, more and more items were added, and today over 100 million items are available through Amazon’s two-day shipping program. This has led to a roll out of one-day and same-day shipping in select areas. This ambitious customer perk now accomplishes two critical functions for Amazon: it builds customer loyalty and it incentivizes Prime memberships that include free shipping (same-day, one-day, two-day) on most items. The one-two punch of increased customer satisfaction and revenue is rare but not altogether unachievable.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In the same way that Amazon’s ambitious shipping program changed their relationship with customers while positively contributing to their bottomline, warranties can also offer companies an opportunity to build customer satisfaction and loyalty, while simultaneously generating passive income for the company providing them.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fbc0658a052bf5924704fc6_drqOVs8wHiQPFfr6Rb9JADAkGEAI8KNQ8pimQRFoqd0ppPZRBeVG9Mfte2S-lZzYbEe6HicQCEKmWaMa5dk_xhW8Lca7mwx4EniVaBpeyZAhEB8YZe9gYbQjf4abrp9i1KlRh2qx.gif" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2>How Clyde Offers A Solution<br></h2><p>At Clyde, our intuitive platform places a premium on ease-of-use and speed for both business owners and their customers. Businesses can opt for eCommerce or in-store solutions, and onboard in less than fifteen minutes. Once integrated with Clyde, owners can decide how to ask their customers to purchase protection — either through a modal pop-up, on the product page, or in the cart. The end result of this partnership is proven revenue growth (+14% AOV) and increased customer satisfaction.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As previously referenced, the McKinsey survey found that consumers are more willing to augment their shopping spending if it helps them save money in the long term (protection plans) and is presented in a seamless and time efficient manner. When a customer purchases a Clyde contract they get instant access to a personalized dashboard. Here they can review products they've bought, buy product protection if they haven't done so, view straightforward terms and conditions, file a claim, and track its progress. Every step of the customer journey has been streamlined to make the warranty purchase as simple as clicking a button.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br><br></p>	Tue Nov 24 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

Behind Clyde: Meet Dr. Monika Heinig	behind-clyde-meet-dr-monika-heinig	Behind Clyde: Meet Dr. Monika Heinig	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6036931123c2c6d9c9fffd10_Monika%20Spotlight%20Artwork%20-%20Option%203%20(1).png	<p>Welcome to the second installment of our "Behind Clyde" series. This is where we’ll be introducing the people who make our work at Clyde possible, with the goal of highlighting and celebrating their different backgrounds, experiences, and contributions.<br></p><h2><strong>Monika Heinig, PhD, Clyde’s Commander of Big Data</strong><br></h2><p>The field of data science has been around for nearly fifty years, stretching back to 1962 when mathematician John W. Tukey predicted the effect of modern-day electronic computing on data analysis as an empirical science. The field has received a significant makeover in the past decade, swiftly upgrading the importance of data in the business world. This explains why a company like Clyde would make Dr. Monika Heinig one of its very first hires. As Apple’s Angela Ahrendts said, “consumer data will be the biggest differentiator in the next two to three years. Whoever unlocks the reams of data and uses it strategically will win.” That’s why Clyde has invested in its data department and is building around Monika.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We sat down with Monika to discuss her professional journey and why utilizing her mathematical skills in the D.S. world is so much fun.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>How did you come to work in data science?&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>Initially my goal was to be a math high school teacher. My undergraduate degree from Seton Hall University was in Mathematics and Secondary Education, but during the fall of my senior year I had two experiences that changed my mind. The first was that I participated in a research project with a math professor of mine that ultimately ended up in my first publication. And that following spring, I taught high school freshmen and sophomores how to solve for X and calculate perimeter, and things of that nature. The experience of going from high level math to teaching basic math at a high school made it clear for me that this wasn’t the path I wanted to follow.<br></p><p>After Seton Hall, I attended Stevens Institute of Technology and earned an M.S. in Applied Mathematics. During my masters program, I got an internship as an actuary and worked there after graduation for about a year and a half. Essentially, I calculated pensions, really exciting stuff, I know. Needless to say, when the opportunity presented itself to go back to Stevens for my PhD, I jumped at the opportunity. I earned my PhD in Mathematics and completed two internships with the government while I was at Stevens. I also did a postdoc at Mount Sinai Hospital doing math analyses on MRI images for MS Patients. It was that experience that opened my eyes to data science. I realized that I was basically conducting data science projects without the official title.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Once I came to that realization, I decided to go all-in on it and completed a data science bootcamp through Insight Data Science. Shortly thereafter, I ended up at Clyde as one of the very first hires and now I have the opportunity to lead all of our data projects as Director of Data Science &amp; Analytics.<br></p><h3><strong>What drew you to data science and why do you think it’s a natural fit for you, given your diverse mathematical skill sets?&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>It was refreshing at the very beginning when I sought out these D.S. bootcamps, because so many were looking for individuals who had already earned their PhDs. That gave me an initial comfort level just as I was getting started.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You learn very quickly that there are all sorts of paths to go down within data science. From Business Intelligence (BI) analytics, which is what I'm doing now, to machine learning. Within those paths you can experience projects that are very engineering-heavy and everything in between.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Given my math background and all of the research projects I had participated in, on top of my actuarial skills, I had the confidence to come in and use these experiences in one career here at Clyde. My experiences really gave me confidence that I could bring it all together.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>How do you describe what you do to non-Math people?&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:38%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/603695152a65c0374ff54799_Data-Scientist.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>I like to start by explaining that I “clean data.” Because the cleaner the data, the better the analysis and output will be for Clyde. Once you have a clean data set, you can utilize historical information to fuel predictive analysis, which ultimately helps us look towards the future as a company. Even when you get into machine learning algorithms, it has to start with clean data, so that’s why I always start there when explaining this role and its importance.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What is a common misconception that people have about data science?&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>I think there’s this misconception that the “final answer” or product is going to be this beautiful, pretty thing. And then when you dig into the data it’s messy and there's all of these nuances. For instance, one of our retailers, I call them the “problem child,” because there's so many issues related to their data. I have to spend a lot of my time cleaning the data so that we can have comparable data sets.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I think there’s also a blanket expectation of sophistication. Not everything in this field requires a machine learning algorithm. Sometimes a simple Excel file can answer the problem. So there’s a balance between what’s possible, what’s most effective and what’s a proper use of resources. To outsiders, they may automatically prefer the method that is the most complicated, or the fanciest. When in reality, each project is unique and may not require the highest levels of sophistication.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What kind of tools do you use on a daily basis?&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>How much time do you have? Because there are so many tools, some of which I’m learning more about every day. So for starters, there’s Postgres, which allows us to access all of our data. Then I’m working with Excel, because it allows me to deliver information internally or externally. On a daily basis, I always have a terminal open and a host of internet browsers and tabs. This gives me access to Mode and Jupyter Notebook, which allows me to do Python. And then there’s just the usual Googling because I need to see examples and ask questions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This isn’t even mentioning Nuclino for documentation and Sublime which allows me to code as well. But as you can see it takes a technological village to get things done in the D.S. world.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>And the big question, “Why Clyde?”</strong><br></h3><p>When I met the founders, it was so clear that these were genuinely good people who wanted to build something special. And to be honest, I'd never worked in an environment where everyone was this nice. That positive environment really brings out the best in me.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And they were very honest upfront, in that they didn’t know that much about data. They knew it was important and wanted to invest in it, but they needed someone to take charge, someone who already had a vision. So to have the opportunity to lead, in a culture where they put their trust in me; that was very appealing. For the first time I was pouring the foundation, so to speak. And given my experience, I kind of knew some of the pitfalls to avoid and how to move quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Really from day one I knew this was the right place for me, and that’s translated to doing essential work while building meaningful relationships.&nbsp;<br></p>	Wed Feb 24 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese
Behind Clyde: Meet Travis Amiel	behind-clyde-meet-travis-amiel	Behind Clyde: Meet Travis Amiel	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ffc6332733d63ab09eb55c3_Travis%20Aimel%20Spotlight%20Artwork%20-%20Option%203.png	<p><em>This is our first "Behind Clyde" post, where we’ll introduce the people who make our work at Clyde possible with the goal of highlighting and celebrating their different backgrounds, experiences, and contributions.</em><br></p><h3><strong>Travis Amiel on the role creative storytelling plays in customer success</strong><br></h3><p>When the rest of Travis Amiel’s middle school class was making tri-fold book reports on what their history class had learned about World War II, Travis was remixing archival clips into a three-minute video.<br></p><p>Travis, who is Clyde’s Merchant Onboarding Specialist, has always had a penchant for doing things his own way. And more often than not, that way has involved combining technology and creativity to tell a story.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>His two main gigs in college are good examples of that. He worked at his school’s IT Help Desk, solving problems under pressure for students and professors, while learning to navigate different types of technology along the way. He served as a student staffer helping run HowlRound, which he describes as “a theater knowledge commons where theatermakers from around the world talk about what they’re making, how they’re making it, and how they’re pushing the field to adopt more countercultural ideas, practice more experimental aesthetics, and be a platform where people who previously haven’t had much representation on stage or around stages have an open platform to share what they’re doing.” One of his biggest projects there was helping to build the World Theater Map, which was a global directory of theater organizations around the world, from puppetry in Sweden to musical theater in Kenya. He also produced shows and live theater.<br></p><p>Travis credits his experience with HowlRound with sparking his love for startups, which is what eventually brought him to Clyde.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Finding a mission to believe in</strong><br></h3><p>Travis knew that he wanted to work for a forward-thinking company that was trying to flip a more established market segment on its head, because that’s what he loved about working in a transformative theater organization.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s exactly what he’s found at Clyde.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:25%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ff877d64ae9af6ffca2068c_28433588_1981761078756193_7380054596913201152_n.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>“The extended warranty world is really messy,” Travis explains. “How can we as a company go in and make that process easier for retailers and merchants? It’s a net positive for everyone involved. Customers know when they buy an extended warranty plan that their product will be protected, merchants have an additional revenue stream and help if something goes wrong, and insurance companies can expand into different categories.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>Travis knew from his first interview with Clyde’s VP of Implementation and Success, Melissa Donahue, that Clyde’s mission and culture aligned with his interests. “<br></p><p>He notes how many miscommunications there are around extended warranties, and how Clyde is setting out to fix those. “Even simple things, like do people need to have a piece of paper, or remember their purchase number? With Clyde, that information is emailed to you, and if you need to file a claim, you can just go to the website and type in your email.”<br></p><h3><strong>How stories can solve problems&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>On a daily basis, Travis works with small and medium businesses who use Clyde to help onboard them onto the platform and troubleshoot any issues with implementation. That can mean helping to solve understanding gaps between the merchant and the insurer, like about how to categorize certain products—is an electronic soccer net part of sporting goods or part of electronics?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Lately, one of his biggest projects has been building out an internal documentation tool for the rest of the Clyde team. The spreadsheet maps the journey that customers go on when they install Clyde. “Writing it felt like programming a game or writing a play or choreographing a dance piece. You do this, and then this happens. It’s that imagination of scripting, which I find very fun when you get it right and you have all the details there, and it’s a great way to explain a complicated process,” he says.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That kind of practical storytelling is so useful, notes Travis, because it allows everyone who works for Clyde to have broader visibility beyond the silo of their day-to-day. A salesperson can check to see what a client’s step-by-step adoption process would be like, for example, or an engineer can see how the marketing team demos part of the app’s functions.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Writing your own story on the job market</strong><br></h3><p>Here at Clyde, Travis has found a role that uses his skills, lines up with his values, and allows him to make a direct impact on a changing industry. He has advice for other young professionals who are thinking about joining a startup, and it’s centered around the importance of narrative.<br></p><p>“Cultivate a narrative around yourself that allows you to explain, ‘This is where I’ve come from, what I’ve done, my achievements, and examples of overcoming problems,’” he says. “Take everything you’ve done and find the right way to articulate your contributions.” An example, he notes, would be taking something that reads relatively dry on paper, like an internship spent doing data entry, and reframing it around the business goals that it augmented, like improving process inefficiencies or building a richer picture of customer segmentation.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Approaching challenges with gratitude and grace</strong><br></h3><p>At the end of the day, Travis says he’s happy to be working for Clyde because it feels like his work is “a real value-add for customers.” He compares Clyde against companies who “do something superfluous for a monthly cost, or promise something but don’t quite deliver on it,” saying, “Clyde has a really clear offering, cost, and use.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>That positive and gratitude-based approach is something Travis applies to other parts of life, too. Even though his extracurricular theater projects have evaporated during the pandemic, he’s since turned to other forms of storytelling and community. “If I can’t work on performances, I do know how to make games and interactive websites and videos, so why don’t I just do more of that and not wallow in being unable to gather?” he asks.&nbsp;<br></p>	Fri Jan 08 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

Its easy-to-use and secure platform keeps operations simple and trusted for both sellers and their customers.<br></p><p>And its open SaaS platform allows for true flexibility and customization—including with an extended warranty program.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Whether you sell headphones or headboards, offering <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/protection-plan-coverage">extended warranties</a> on your products can help both your customers and your bottom line.<br></p><p>A well-run warranty partner can help your business <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/merchant-dashboard-features">increase average order value</a>, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/customer-loyalty">increase customer loyalty</a>, and increase conversions. Customers enjoy a stronger peace of mind, knowing that their purchase is protected, and are more likely to stay loyal even if something goes wrong.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And sellers like you see extra profit through a high-margin sales channel that’s easy to manage—if you pick the right extended warranty partner.<br></p><p>But how are you meant to do that?<br></p><p>Here, we explain how to decide on warranty management options for your BigCommerce store (and where Clyde fits in).<br></p><h2>What To Look for in BigCommerce Management Software</h2><p>One of the things sellers love about BigCommerce is how it allows for product variants. Without having to dig deep and code custom solutions, you can create up to 600 versions of your items so that customers can easily browse for exactly what they’re looking for.<br></p><p>You’ll want your chosen extended warranty partner to be just as in tune with what your customers need.<br></p><p>To that end, you’ll want to look for a warranty partner who performs well along the following categories:&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Flexibility in product coverage.&nbsp;</h3><p>You want to make sure that you’re choosing a partner who can cover all of the products you sell. Some warranty partners work with a single insurance focused on a niche market, like computers or furniture. If you sell a wide range of products, make sure that you’re covered for all of them.<br></p><h3>Automated operational tasks.</h3><p>Once the software is installed, will it run in the background of your BigCommerce site without requiring you to do much else? Make sure you understand the operational tasks that you’ll be expected to do to run your warranty program, if any exist.<br></p><h3>Customization options.</h3><p>You’ll want your warranty software to integrate seamlessly into your current purchasing process. Look for software that allows for the creation of unique call-to-actions that can be co-branded with your company, allowing you to add your logo, color scheme, font, and brand voice to the check-out process.<br></p><h3>Multiple CTAs.</h3><p>To sell warranties, you’ll use CTAs that prompt buyers to add a warranty to their purchase. Ideally, your chosen warranty partner will give you several options for integrating those CTAs into the purchase process, and you’ll also be able to select how you present extended warranty options (from a single link to a comprehensive list) and to experiment with different presentations.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Pricing adjustments to drive revenue.</h3><p>Do you want to decide exactly how much to charge for your warranty? The software you choose should let you. A bonus is software that uses historical data to auto-manage the margins you’ll earn on warranty sales to optimize revenue.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Multiple users with custom permissions.</h3><p>Who will be managing your warranty plan? If you’ve got more than one person who will want to stay up close and personal to how your extended warranty program is performing, make sure the software you choose lets you add and manage multiple team members.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Regular reporting and analytics.</h3><p>You don’t want to have to dig for information on the warranties you’re selling. Look for software partners that offer clear, customizable analytics dashboards where you can keep an eye on things like contracts sold, product value covered, contract revenue earned, and your profit.<br></p><h3>A responsive support team.</h3><p>Hopefully nothing goes wrong as you bring on an extended warranty partner, but in the case that onboarding isn’t quite as simple as you’d hoped or you have questions about implementation, you’ll want to make sure you can get real support from a knowledgeable source. Check out the customer service options available from each provider before making your choice, and if they only offer chat or email help, make sure you’re comfortable with that option.<br></p><h3>An easy-to-use customer portal.</h3><p>Keep in mind that your customers may be reaching out for support, too, as they submit claims. Do you feel comfortable with your chosen provider representing your brand? Is there an easy way for customers to get help?<br></p><h2>BigCommerce Warranty Management Providers</h2><p>With a long list of things to look for in a BigCommerce warranty management provider, you’ll want to do your research before deciding.&nbsp;</p><p>As you’re looking through the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/">BigCommerce App Marketplace</a> for extended warranty integrations, keep in mind that most warranty management providers have their own niche.&nbsp;</p><p>They may be focused on enterprise clients. Or on niche eCommerce vendors.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps they’ve got great offerings for certain products, but not for everything you offer. (Or maybe they can cover everything, but you’ll have to match your products’ eligibility to a network of their insurer partners.)&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/clyde/">Clyde’s BigCommerce integration</a> works with retailers of all sizes and across all industries, with warranty program solutions for everyone. In fact, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/clyde-and-bigcommerce">Clyde is an Elite partner of BigCommerce</a>, selected for its best-in-class tech, value, and customer service.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you sell electronics, appliances, jewelry, furniture, sports equipment, outdoor equipment, or general merchandise, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/resources/documentation/bigcommerce-warranty-app">Clyde’s</a> got you covered. We offer a portfolio of insurance partners to offer exactly the protection you need, and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection">we can cover everything</a> from warranty extensions to wear and tear to water damage and accidents.&nbsp;</p><h2>Benefits of Using Warranty Management for BigCommerce</h2><p>There are benefits of using warranty management software on BigCommerce stores for both merchants and their consumers. </p><h3>Passive revenue</h3><p>Retailers can add to their average order values and their profit margins without having to shell out to create new products or a different service model. A good warranty program partner will manage everything from the customer’s side, leaving merchants to sit back and watch the revenue roll in. Strengthened relationship with consumers<strong><br></strong>Offering an extended warranty plan to your customers is like offering them peace of mind. They’ll feel supported and confident in their purchase.&nbsp;</p><h3>Strengthened relationship with consumers<strong><br></strong></h3><p>Offering an extended warranty plan to your customers is like offering them peace of mind. They’ll feel supported and confident in their purchase.&nbsp;</p><h3>Regular touchpoints</h3><p>And as a retailer offering extended warranties, you’re guaranteeing yourself a regular (and customer-appreciated) <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">touchpoint</a> to engage with them down the line, whether at a one, two, or three year mark when their extended warranty is up, to reconnect and drive future sales.</p><h2>How to Configure Clyde’s Warranty Management App for BigCommerce</h2><p>To <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/resources/documentation/bigcommerce-warranty-app">integrate Clyde into your BigCommerce site</a>, you shouldn’t need more than a few minutes. Our app is built to have a seamless integration with little to no coding involved, though certain storefronts with particular custom behaviors may need to customize the integration slightly. (We’ll provide a few options for that at the end of this guide, and are always <a href="mailto:support@joinclyde.com">here to answer questions</a> if you have them!)</p><ol><li>First, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/resources/documentation/bigcommerce-warranty-app">install our BigCommerce app</a>. (It’ll log you in to your Clyde dashboard versus the app’s UI within the BigCommerce admin panel.)</li><li>Then, fill out as much information as possible in your shop info.&nbsp;</li></ol><ul><li>We need your contact information in case we ever need to reach you, and for insurance compliance reasons, we need your business's address info.&nbsp;</li><li>We'll pull as much as we can automatically from BigCommerce, but would love for you to double-check that everything's filled out and accurate!</li></ul><ol start="3"><li>Next, you can check out some of the customization options available that affect the look and behavior of your storefront CTAs. Detailed examples and more info are available on the page itself, and you can change these settings at any time after onboarding.</li><li>Then, set up billing. You can connect a bank account using Stripe microdeposits or Plaid instant verification.&nbsp;</li></ol><ul><li>If you opt for Stripe, remember that your microdeposits can take a few days to appear in your bank account, and that the values to verify the account should be entered in cents exactly as they appear in your bank.&nbsp;</li><li>You can set up billing during onboarding or afterwards, but you won't be able to start selling contracts before this is done.</li></ul><ol start="5"><li>The last item in onboarding is reviewing and agreeing to our Terms and Conditions. If you have any questions here or throughout onboarding, feel free to reach out to support@joinclyde.com and we'll work with you on any questions or problems!</li><li>Once you're done onboarding, Clyde's got some work to do! We will review your catalog and assign warranties to be presented to your customers. Once that's done, you're ready to launch contracts to your site.</li></ol><p>If you want to add a CTA on your cart page, you may need to keep in mind how storefront CTAs work on BigCommerce:</p><ul><li>Clyde’s CTAs leverage the BigCommerce storefront graphQL API, a feature available to all BigCommerce stores using a stencil theme. This feature is available but not necessarily enabled for your store. You can reach out to BigCommerce support to get it enabled and use our CTAs straight out of the box.</li><li>By default, Clyde’s BigCommerce app comes with three prompts: Product page, Modal, and Cart. You can turn any of these prompts on or off from your Clyde dashboard's CTA page. Due to the custom nature of BigCommerce carts, the cart prompt on your cart page requires the addition of a single line to your cart's theme code. Each line item rendered on your cart page should have an empty HTML &lt;div&gt; appended to the spot where you want to see a prompt added. The exact structure should be the following:&lt;/div&gt;</li></ul><ul><li>&lt;div class="clyde-cart-attach-point" data-item-id="{{id}}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</li><li>(Where the {{id}} in handlebars format is the ID of the line item)</li></ul><ul><li>If Clyde's out-of-the-box CTAs don't work exactly as you want, or break because of a particular setup on your store page, reach out and we can help.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>We can either configure your CTAs from our end to solve the issue, and if all else fails, get you started with Clyde's widget.</li><li>The widget is a script you can add to your store in place of the default storefront script that builds your CTAs. Using the widget, you can build all of the Clyde prompts to satisfy whatever custom behavior needed for your shop. For more information, check out the widget docs <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/resources/documentation/platform-integrations/getting-started-with-widget">here</a>.</li></ul><p><em>Note: Clyde's app relies on the assets provided only in BigCommerce Stencil themes. In order to use Clyde in a BigCommerce shop that uses Blueprint, you'll need to set your CTAs up using our widget.</em></p><h2>All set!&nbsp;</h2><p>That’s it.

Then, with shoppers wiped out from major expenditures in the fourth quarter, the first quarter of the new year tends to look pretty dismal. Annual eCommerce spending looks like a wave that peaks in Q4, drops sharply in Q1, and swells slightly through Q2 and Q3 before climbing sharply again in Q4. Take a look:<br><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fd38754921aa0a8977eb418_WYsUNbLL-xf4ki9j6A-svwS_8_8yc282oYTs-m4P4bzueNYQ88QlPfJyR87b4z_Dop_0xXFAmfqjlhQYGLtKkLQHvCjPor6B6GkxaV-go3fS0V9aqm6Z50gxCz2Veeq9cLKHI5Hj.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>In a normal year, retailers have to be patient and creative to get through off-season slumps. And 2020 isn’t a normal year.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What seasonality looks like this year and how to combat it&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>With economic hardship meaning that <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/consumer-trends/">1 in 4 Americans are planning on spending less</a> this holiday season, even an <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/holiday-retail-sales-consumer-survey.html?">increase in eCommerce spending</a> may not make up for losses sustained throughout this year and early next.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So what options are left? Sales pushes could work—who says you can’t make a big marketing push for Groundhog Day?—but they’re expensive, and your customers will probably be burned out on email campaigns and banner ads.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Enter passive income.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Long a buzzy phrase in eCommerce, it usually refers to a set of low- or, ideally, no-investment-needed ways to rake in cash like dropshipping, affiliate programs, and ebook sales. And while some people and some retailers do make a killing off of those, if you’re selling consumer goods, that’s a pivot you’re unlikely to make. If your product is mattresses, you <em>could</em> have your content team write an ebook about sleep hygiene and start selling it. But that might not be the best move for your brand or your bottom line.<br></p><p>Try offering extended warranties instead.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>How extended warranties work</strong><br></h3><p>Extended warranties are what they sound like: additional product protection on top of a manufacturer’s warranty. They’re more than that, too: they’re peace of mind. If a customer breaks their product or has any sort of issue with it, they can turn to their extended warranty for help fixing the problem.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Extended warranties enhance the customer experience and the retailer’s bottom line. If there is a product issue, retailers can capture future sales by replacing or repairing it. And adding product protection options can <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-to-grow-average-order-value-post-purchase">increase AOV</a> and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/10-ways-for-retailers-to-improve-customer-lifetime-value-ltv-clv">improve LTV</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Passive income in action</strong><br></h3><p>Plans could be the highest-margin product you sell—and a truly passive source of income.<br></p><p>By choosing an extended warranty partner like <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Clyde</a>, you can offload all of the logistics and management of the program while still reaping the profit. Our platform integrates with your website in minutes and can automatically optimize your pricing with AI autopilot functionality. When customers file a claim, they’ll do through their easy-to-navigate Clyde dashboard and we’ll oversee its resolution. You’ll get real-time transparency into your program’s results.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Generally, it takes a couple of months from when we onboard a new retailer to when they start to see the full effects of extended warranty purchases on sales numbers. There’s no better time to start a program than now. In the short term, you can capture last-minute holiday shoppers, and over the next few months, you can drive up your AOV on every sale and recoup potential lost sales from any product issues or replacements.<br></p><p>Let’s look at an example. Say you’re the mattress seller I mentioned in the intro. Usually, you see a decent-sized uptick in sales for the holidays from people wanting to treat themselves and their loved ones to the gift of good night sleep. If you implement an extended warranty program now, you could see jumps in your profit margin immediately. But more importantly, the sales you make in January, February, and March will get that same boost right when you need it the most, without you having to spend a single dollar in advertising, R&amp;D, production, storage, or shipping.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Getting ahead of next season’s lull is a good idea</strong><br></h3><p>The Q1 slump might hit extra hard next year, thanks to the economic downturn we’ve been living through as a result of the pandemic, but the first quarter has always been the hardest time to be a retailer.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s long past time for innovative passive-income strategies to step to the forefront. These strategies can help shore up cash flow and ease out some of the steepness of that sales curve, and extended warranties are a great way to do that.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Learn more</a> about how Clyde drives revenue for retailers.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	Fri Dec 11 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
A brief history of product protection	brief-history-of-product-protection	A Brief History of Product Protection	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc997bfafbb827386e8d698_Blog_Stars%20passing%20time.1.png	<p>If you’ve ever bought an Apple product, chances are you were asked if you’d like to purchase AppleCare to protect your new gadget. AppleCare is Apple’s own branded product protection plan that covers against damage incurred by causes not covered by the terms of the manufacturer’s warranty or after it expires. Big insurance companies have been writing service contracts and protecting consumers’ purchases for decades. In the past several years, however, technology has begun to disrupt the way the industry operates.</p><p>The market for extended warranties is closing in on $50 billion annually. That’s huge, but it didn’t get that big overnight. Here’s a snapshot of how the product protection industry has taken shape over the years and where it’s headed.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc9944c464dfb409b0418b5_Prod%20Protection%20Timeline.png"></div></figure><h3>AIG cements product protection as an industry</h3><p>In 1919, CV Starr founded American Asiatic Underwriters in Shanghai, China. The firm began offering coverage for a number of different categories including property, cementing product protection as an industry. In 1967, the firm was renamed the “American International Group” (AIG). <a href="https://www.aig.com/business/insurance/warranty" data-rt-link-type="external">In the last thirty years</a>, AIG has gobbled up over 20% of the service contract market. They currently underwrite &nbsp;protection plans for AppleCare as well as Best Buy.</p><h3>Major brands begin offering extended warranties</h3><p>Walmart and Apple are founded in 1962 and 1976, respectively, and begin offering their customers protection plans that offer coverage beyond the scope of what the manufacturer’s warranty covers. Today, Apple’s branded protection plan, AppleCare, is the <a href="https://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20170921.html" data-rt-link-type="external">largest protection program</a> in the world thanks to the proliferation of the iPhone. In 2015, Apple sold $7.25 billion worth of AppleCare contracts.</p><h3>Congress implements regulations on warranties</h3><p>In 1975, Congress passed the Magnuson-Moss Act. The law does not require all products sold to come with a warranty, however those that do must have clear, fair, and enforceable ones. It also grants the FTC with increased power to protect consumers. Extended warranties are treated differently by each State and as a result are regulated in a variety of ways. <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/ogco2001/rg107131.htm" data-rt-link-type="external">In New York</a>, for example, a service contract is not regulated as a warranty or as an insurance product, however anyone who wants to sell as service contract must be registered to do so. </p><h3>Enterprise insurers begin specializing in product protection</h3><p>Asurion and Amtrust are founded in 1995 and 1998, respectively. The emergence of large firms that specialize in product protection signals that this segment of the insurance industry has entered the mainstream. This push into the mainstream is fueled by the increasing availability of cellphones and consumer electronics in the 1990s. Today AmTrust and Asurion both own large portions of Amazon’s account.</p><h3>Tech companies begin disrupting the insurance industry</h3><p>Justworks is founded in 2012. The startup brings innovation to health insurance by aggregating product pools to decrease the risk taken on by insurers and increasing the size of the insurable market. In 2016, Allstate enters the product protection space by acquiring SquareTrade. This signals enterprise insurers’ acknowledgement of the value technology can add to their industry and encourages further innovation.</p><h3>Clyde is founded (!!)</h3><p>Clyde is founded in 2017, marking technology’s entrance into product insurance. Similar to Justworks, Clyde aggregates both insurance products and retailers while prioritizing access, design, and ease of use. Since Clyde’s founding, several other startups have followed suit, highlighting the large potential for technology to improve the product insurance industry.</p><p><br></p>	Wed May 01 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jacob-stein
Building Loyalty with Newly Acquired Customers: Insights from The CommerceNext Webinar	building-loyalty-with-newly-acquired-customers	Building Loyalty with Newly Acquired Customers: Insights from The CommerceNext Webinar	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6061d0ad95e38867362ee2ce_New%20Customer%20Loyalty%202.jpg	<p>It’s clear that the pandemic sped up the shift to e-commerce and sent online sales skyrocketing.<br></p><p>And it looks like those trends are here to stay. During the first two months of January, consumers spent <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/15/adobe-digital-economy-index-covid-19-report.html#gs.x5f9h0">$121 billion</a> online, 34% more than the same period last year, and analysts expect 2022 to be the first trillion-dollar year for e-commerce.<br></p><p>But how can companies keep up with growth as the market gets only more competitive? How can they turn their newly acquired customers into long-term return buyers and brand advocates?&nbsp;<br></p><p>This week’s CommerceNext webinar focused on exploring that question, with insight from:&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li>Brandon Gell, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Clyde</li><li>Sherri Kuo, Head of Growth at Italic</li><li>Matt Hayes, Co-founder at The Fascination</li><li>Jeff Gerstel, CMO at B&amp;H Photo Video</li><li>Scott Silverman, Co-Founder at CommerceNext<br></li></ul><h2><strong>The state of customer acquisition</strong><br></h2><p>The webinar started off with polling an audience of marketing, product, and sales professionals who shared the following insights:<br></p><ul><li><strong>72% of companies are seeing that customers acquired during the pandemic are at least somewhat different from existing customers&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Only <strong>3% </strong>of companies rate their ability to leverage customer touch points to increase sales an engagement as a 9 or 10—most people give themselves about a <strong>5</strong>, suggesting there’s plenty of room for improvement</li><li><strong>67% of companies are investing more in customer insights this year compared to past years</strong><br></li></ul><p>So with an interest in understanding these new types of customers, a lack of confidence in how to have successful touch points with them, and a willingness to invest in gaining that knowledge, what’s a company to do?<br></p><h2><strong>More helpful messages, not more messages: the “touchpoint Trojan horse”</strong><br></h2><p>Sending better, more targeted communications is the answer.<br></p><p>Clyde spends a lot of time thinking about, researching, and building better ways to communicate with customers. What we’ve found after four years and 200 merchant partners is that one type of email tends to rise above the chatter and churn of a busy inbox: <strong>transactional emails</strong>.<br></p><p>We wrote <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">a whitepaper about how they work</a>, and here are the highlights:<br></p><ul><li>100 million emails are blocked every day</li><li>With goals of increasing lifetime value and building loyalty with customers, it’s understandable why brands rely on email</li><li>But transactional emails, or messages specific to a commercial engagement or that are time-bound in some way, are opened more than marketing emails</li><li>78% of emails with subject lines related to protection plans are opened</li><li>After a customer has opened a transactional email, retailers can:</li></ul><ul><li>Offer complementary products&nbsp;</li><li>Ask for valuable feedback</li><li>Offer exclusive access to new products</li><li>Share reviews of additional products</li><li>Or add product protection&nbsp;<br></li></ul><h2><strong>8 principles to figure out who your customers are, communicate with them, and treat them well—in transactional emails and in general</strong><br></h2><p>With a panel discussion and a live Q&amp;A with attendees, the conversation during the webinar was full of useful takeaways for anyone interested in the future of retaining customers and building loyalty. Here are eight principles shared by the panel to do just that:<br></p><ol><li><strong>All the consumer insight software in the world can help you connect with your customer base, but two business practices help more. </strong>They’re 1) go with your gut when you’re at a crossroads, and 2) talk directly to customers and get firsthand feedback on how they’re responding to your platform, said Matt. You need the healthy mix of science and art of marketing and customer service, so don’t over-index on just the science. “There’s no replacement for talking to customers,” agreed Sherri. “Don’t discard that very human element.”<br></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Start from the lens of “what can we do for them?” </strong>Brandon highlighted how Clyde’s product team has added flexible options when it comes to reaching out to customers about product protection options so that they don’t get hit with an email about an extended warranty on a purchase that still hasn’t been delivered. “We’re delivering value [where] there’s something in it for them,” he explained.<br></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Make sure you have a solid brand story. “Before you start selling and pushing products, sales, or offers, customers need to understand why you exist and where you fit in their commerce in their mind,” says Matt. Knowing that lets companies then go on to figure out what kind of authentic hooks resonate with their audience and what the best way to deliver more content is.</strong><br></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><strong>Experiment with content. </strong>Content can be a great way to build customer loyalty and improve their experience of a given product or service, but there’s no one-size-fits-all model, even once a brand has their story down. For instance, Matt’s found success for his online marketplace with in-depth product reviews and fun round-ups. Sherri has seen honest, behind-the-scenes blog posts that reveal the lengths their team goes to in order to develop new products really take off with their audience. And Jeff has seen video content become a “magic medium” for everything from customer testimonials to providing training resources to telling their brand story.<br></li></ol><ol start="5"><li><strong>Leverage all the available touchpoints to meet your audience where they are. </strong>Matt shared that with his B2C mattress company Leesa, his team was ahead of the game when it came to utilizing push notifications to communicate with customers, but missed the boat on email flows and SMS. Now, with The Fascination, he’s focusing on how to build his audience and capture its attention from the start. “From the pandemic shifting buying behavior, to rising CACs and Facebook and Google options, to attributions through iOS14, all of these things are putting a damper on performance marketing and the ability to go and acquire customers, but the one thing that you have ultimate control over is your own audience,” he said.<br></li></ol><ol start="6"><li><strong>Remember that service still reigns supreme. </strong>Jeff has taken B&amp;H Photo back to one of the most basic tenets of sales: taking care of the customer. “We’re oriented around an old-school service approach,” he explained. As sales of Zoom-friendly cameras and hobbyist equipment took off, their business was faced with supply chain issues, shipping delays, and a “ratcheting down of the ability to execute.” To compensate, they focused on what they could control: communicating honestly about delays, offering product repairs or replacements for anything that arrived damaged, and making their expanded website as easy as possible to navigate.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="7"><li><strong>Pay it forward. </strong>Sherri shared that Italic was looking to expand their customer engagement methods and decided to try out their version of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/11/business/costco-5-dollar-chicken/index.html">Costco rotisserie chickens</a> (or something customers are obsessed with and appreciate that brands offer even when they’re not making money on them, aka a loss-leader). They launched “Thank You Thursdays” for their member base, selecting best-selling products and offering them at even more reduced prices to show their customers how much Italic appreciates them.<br></li></ol><ol start="8"><li><strong>Consider loyalty programs. </strong>Start with asking your customers what they want.<strong> </strong>Italic is thinking about adding a higher-touch concierge service, as customers flag that they’d be interested. The Fascination is thinking about incentives that have worked in the marketplace space, from product gift cards for sharing the site to a points program to get their referral flywheel running. (Matt specifically recommended Kickoff Class, Swell, and Yaghtpro for B2C brands looking to build repeat customers and higher lifetime values through a rewards program.) But remember that loyalty programs aren’t for everyone—Jeff said that B&amp;H Photo Video takes the view that every customer should be treated great, and that such a program wouldn’t be right for their audience.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>Have further questions for Brandon on how Clyde can transform the post-sale communication you have with your customers? <a href="http://brandon@joinclyde.com">Ask him</a>!</p><p><br></p>	Mon Mar 29 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

We’re also thrilled to announce our partnership with global tech care company Asurion, the leading protection plan provider, as an obligor. Additionally, Asurion will provide our retail partners and customers with access to the company’s vast network of repair servicers across the country. Clyde now offers our retail partners a seamless, in-platform claims experience combined with the scale, service, and support expertise of Asurion.</p><p>When we started Clyde over two years ago, our mission was to make protection plans accessible for retailers of all sizes by giving merchants the ability to launch top-tier product protection programs with the scale, quality, and pricing reserved for Fortune 10 companies, and to give consumers access to an easy to use, affordable, quality service.</p><p>To fully realize this mission, Clyde is taking ownership of the entire customer journey—from contract purchase to claims resolution, and we’re&nbsp;working with the leading obligors in the product warranty space. We decided to build our administrative capabilities from the ground up, putting the customer experience first.</p><p>As an administrator, Clyde is re-imagining the claims administration process in two ways. First, Clyde offers auto-adjudication, or real-time claims decisions. Second, our auto-resolution capabilities provide multiple ways of claim fulfillment. Clyde supports three claim fulfillment methods: cash reimbursement (via Venmo, PayPal, or check), promo code payout, or product repair or replacement. Clyde also enables our merchant partners to be the main point of contact for extended warranty claims filing — all within Clyde’s platform.</p><p>Clyde’s administrative arm comes on the heels of our new partnership with Asurion. Through this strategic partnership, we will offer our retail partners highly competitive rates and a significantly expanded range of coverage.</p><p>We are excited for how our new claims administration capabilities and Asurion’s wealth of experience in the extended warranty space will help us continue to deliver a truly exceptional experience for retailers and their customers.<br></p><p>Read the full announcement <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200810005038/en/Clyde-Launches-Claims-Administration-Partners-Asurion-Deliver">here</a>.</p><p><br></p>	Mon Aug 10 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	brandon-gell

Because the vast majority of eCommerce retailers were missing out on the opportunity to better serve consumers through extended warranties, we developed Clyde, a platform that has to-date given this opportunity to more than 150 retailers and tens of thousands of their customers. <strong>Today, we’re proud to announce we’ve raised $14M in a Series A to continue to dramatically improve this market, both for eCommerce companies and the people who buy their products.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>This new injection of funding, led by Spark Capital with participation from Crosslink, RRE, Red Sea Ventures, Abstract Ventures, Starting Line Capital, Correlation Ventures, Jackson Gates, Brian Sugar, and other leaders in the ecommerce and fintech space will help us expand our capabilities to serve a new wave of retail partners. We believe that product protection is one of the strongest tools retailers have at their disposal to drive customer loyalty and revenue. Unfortunately, it’s a category marred by mishandling from big insurance corporations with little care for the customer experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Clyde’s goal is to completely reshape the warranty market — both in its accessibility for retailers and in its experience and value for consumers — through software that can be deployed in just minutes, allowing retailers to offer extended warranties that cover almost anything — from sunglasses and headphones, to snowboards and telescopes, and beyond. For retailers, it’s the ability to provide something of value to the people who purchase their products, while simultaneously adding a net-new revenue stream. For consumers, it’s the opportunity to protect their purchases at the lowest, most transparent rates. The experience for both is seamless, integrated, valuable, and easy — the antithesis of what’s typically associated with this space.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Clyde’s Impact To-Date<br></h3><p>Clyde SKUs are often the highest-margin product that our customers sell. We’ve heard from customers that they’re able to double-down on acquiring new customers, design and build new products, or expand their social reach as a result of the additional revenue Clyde drives.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Consumers are seeing the value and enjoying the experience too: the uptake of warranty purchases averages 18 percent for retailers using Clyde — with some seeing uptake as high as 30 percent. This, compared to the industry average of just four percent, speaks volumes about the Clyde experience for the end user purchasing product protection.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here’s what a few customers have shared about working with Clyde:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Kate Albers, the E-Commerce Manager at <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com/">Chili</a> (a company on a mission to build the best sleep products using science), said their partnership with Clyde has "activated an additional revenue stream and allowed us to expand a new area of our business — yielding a better experience for our team and our customers.” With Clyde, Chili has reached an attachment rate of 38% on one of their products (over 5x the industry average).</li><li>Two of our new customers, <a href="http://tuftandneedle.com">Tuft &amp; Needle</a> and <a href="https://www.marshallheadphones.com/us/en/">Marshall Headphones</a>, also weighed in on why they recently chose to partner with Clyde. Tuft &amp; Needle Head of Customer Experience Aaron Bata shared that, “On our mission to reshape how shoppers think about sleep, we have made it our goal to put the customer at the forefront of every mattress purchase, and thus transform an industry. Clyde enables us to deliver on this goal and, in turn, further revolutionize the sleep industry.” While Marshall Headphones’ E-commerce Manager, Karla Wallace, expressed that “We chose to partner with Clyde because it’s a proven driver of brand loyalty, and it allows our customers to protect the signature sound that our products deliver.”<br></li></ul><h3><strong>Looking Forward</strong><br></h3><p>It’s humbling to announce this good news during a trying time for so many in our category. We know that now, more than ever, eCommerce is of the utmost importance — we’re looking the data square in the face. We’re doing what we can to tip the scales in the favor of independent retailers and brands.<br></p><p>Our investors bring a new wealth of experience to Clyde leadership, and we are excited to partner with them as we continue to grow our business and our team.</p><p>‍</p><p>Looking forward,<br>Brandon Gell &amp;&nbsp;Team Clyde<br></p><p>‍</p><p><em>You can read more on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/clyde-raises-14-million-series-a-to-help-e-commerce-businesses-offer-extended-warranty-plans/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><em>.</em><br></p>	Mon May 11 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	brandon-gell

Retailers build businesses to do two things – sell their core product(s) and develop strong relationships with customers. There are infinite ways to do this <em>better, </em>but if you can’t sell product, then you don’t have a business.<br></p><p>At Clyde, we talk to online, in-store, direct to consumer, and enterprise retailers daily. We hear about what they’re working on, what they’re struggling with, and what they’re hoping to achieve. We’ve had over 1000 businesses install our app, had countless retailers reach out asking when we’ll be available on their platform, for advice on their existing warranty programs, or how to optimize their conversion. We’ve matched Clyde’s contracts to over 300,000 products (instantly), have achieved an attachment rate over 10%, surpassing the industry average of &nbsp;4%, and are giving startup to Fortune 1000 businesses access to enterprise technology. Technology that the best insurers in the industry are asking for access to. <br></p><p>We’ve learned a lot over a short period of time – most of all, you shouldn’t have to understand the insurance industry to be successful at selling contracts. Your business has one focus, to sell product.<em>‍</em></p><h3>We learned to speak insurance so you don’t have to.<br></h3><h6>Over the past two years we’ve also had the chance to really understand our customers. We have three different kinds:</h6><ol><li>Businesses that never thought of offering product protection, but choose to do so with Clyde.</li><li>Businesses that switch to Clyde from an existing insurer, usually because their existing programs perform really poorly, have a bad NPS, or they were fed up with their insurers technology (or lack of it).</li><li>Businesses that keep their insurance partners, but choose to use Clyde’s technology. Our programs perform significantly better and our tech facilitates collection of data that wasn’t previously useful to a business or insurer.<br></li></ol><h6>Today, I’m extremely excited to announce the launch of numerous things we’ve been working on in 2019:</h6><ol><li>Our new brand — we’ve updated our website, calls-to-action, and dashboard.

Clyde Recognized as one of eight startups changing insurance	clyde-recognized-startups-changing-insurance	Clyde Recognized as One of Eight Startups Changing Insurance	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc79a5939f4125bf2569c0b_Blog_next%20bounce.3.png	<p>In Feb. 2019 Built In NYC listed Clyde among <a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2019/02/22/nyc-insurance-tech-companies" data-rt-link-type="external">8 startups changing insurance</a>.</p><p>At Clyde we pride ourselves on being tech experts, collaborators and students of our market. We learn from practical experience, experience that is anchored by the day-in, day-out of running a retail business. And so Clyde was borne by necessity. Similar to many of the businesses that we now serve, when searching for accessible product insurance options, we found none. Next we identified the core challenges surfaced by our search. Then, we solved them. </p><p>Through problem solving we developed a new platform as an insurance technology solution. The Clyde Platform turns a once cumbersome problem into a scalable solution by seamlessly connecting the dots between retailers, insurers and administrators. <br></p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.cbre.us/research-and-reports/E-Commerce-by-Retail-Category-Finally-Revealed-by-US-Census-Bureau" data-rt-link-type="external">report</a> by the CBRE, which assessed retail data from the US census, about 30% of all ecommerce retail is sold by small and midsize enterprises - a notoriously overlooked segment. By solving for this core group of businesses, Clyde addressed larger, intractable problems that have slowed the product insurance industry for years. Here is how we met that 30% disconnect. </p><h3>We shortened the underwriting runway.<br></h3><p>The Clyde Platform matches submitted items with pre-approved contracts to cut down the underwriting process. </p><p>Warranties, like other insurance options, are offered based on a risk assessment process called underwriting. Underwriting applies dollar amounts to known variables of an associated product, for example, the likelihood of me dropping my cell phone into a toilet. In this case the cell phone is the associated product and water damage is the known variable. Traditionally, underwriting is done on a case-by-case basis. But there are a few problems with traditional underwriting: </p><h4>1. New products are unknowns.</h4><p>When it comes to known unknowns, new products might be the greatest headache insurers face. For instance, how could an insurance company know that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/survey-75-percent-of-americans-admit-to-using-phone-while-in-bathroom/" data-rt-link-type="external">75% of Americans</a> use their cell phones in the bathroom, if no one has owned a cell phone before. This gap in analysis would normally be a big problem. But, by working with retailers to establish a base level of risk and fine-tuning over time, we remove requirements for years worth of insurance company data. &nbsp;</p><h4>2. Case-by-case underwriting is a lot of manual labor. </h4><p>By knowing a little more about the variables that underwriters contend with, it becomes easier to understand their workload. New products aren’t easy. But neither are catalogs of thousands of known products -- each with its own set of variables. &nbsp;</p><h4>3. Time and money are positively correlated.</h4><p>In today’s world we expect inverse correlations, especially between money and time. The more money we pay for something, the less time we expect is needed for its completion. But that is not always the case with product insurance, where more money may simply mean a more complex item, more variables and more time spent analyzing it all. Matching items brings this equation back to something we’d expect. With the right investment, businesses can reduce the time it takes to get coverage and even minimize their spend.</p><p>By matching new items with similar, existing contracts, everyone wins. Insurers can more simply scale their services up or down to fit a larger set of retailers. Businesses, enterprise to small, can find an insurance option that fits their product without investing heaps of time and money.</p><h3>We added technical interoperability.<br></h3><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/15/how-the-internet-was-invented-1976-arpa-kahn-cerf" data-rt-link-type="external">Forty years ago</a> the internet was a defense department communication network. Nowadays the internet is the retailer’s shopping mall. But, having been designed for a largely analog shopping experience, pre-internet insurance and administrator institutions are understandably slow to meet the demands of new technology. By working with top e-commerce platforms like Shopify and Magento, developing an API and providing an SDK for custom work, Clyde brings retailers the coverage they want and delivers it where it’s needed. </p><h3>We connected the dots between insurance players.<br></h3><p>Every industry has its own supply chain nuances. The product insurance industry is no different. Insurers, administrators and tech each have a distinct checkpoint along the path to service delivery. By approaching the industry as students, rather than pharmacists, we learned before getting prescriptive. What was our one big learning? Networking counts. <strong><br></strong>Most product insurance providers have a fairly narrow market of product categories under their coverage. Considering the manual labor it takes to maintain insured products, that limited scope makes sense. But for retailers, limited coverage quickly becomes a quagmire of matching products to insurers and administrators. If a retailer sells road bikes and electronics like GPS units to be mounted on those bikes, then they likely need a specialized insurer for the bike and a separate one for the GPS. Now imagine this retailer dreams of complete sports market domination. That retailer will be dependent on more insurance relationships, more rates and more administrators based on the growing number of product categories it offers.</p><p>The Clyde Platform solves the problem of divergence by leveraging our network of cross category insurers and administrators to serve our partner businesses. Clyde fits in to provide the product and market knowledge needed to connect retailers with the insurers and administrators that they need. Our matching capability uses technology to keep retailers moving - no checkpoints, no speed bumps. </p><h3>We deliver customer loyalty.<br></h3><p>We believe that customer loyalty is more than a benchmark. From our beginning as retailers and through our launch of the Clyde Platform, customer experience and loyalty have been our guide.</p><p>Loyalty happens when a customer makes a purchase they can trust, when that trust becomes a narrative of enjoyment, assurance and reliability. </p><p>Clyde is here to help move customers, touchpoint by touchpoint, toward enjoying their purchases and building brand loyalty. We aim to surpass the insurance market status quo. By working with partner businesses to understand average order value, margin and attachment rate, Clyde helps translate touchpoints into action plans, from consideration to repeat customer. </p><p>Where once there were numbers and variables, Clyde is there. We’ve learned to speak insurance so you don’t have to. </p><p><br></p>	Mon Apr 15 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jericho-shackelford

Clyde’s Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: A Transparent Update	clydes-commitment-to-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-a-transparent-update	Clyde’s Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: A Transparent Update	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f749d0c61d985199a838fc1_Option%20One%20(1).png	<p>These last few months have inspired a reckoning not just at Clyde but at companies and in communities around the country.</p><p>The triple crises of a global pandemic, systematic racism, and police brutality came to a head in June. George Floyd’s tragic murder came on the back of three months of a deadly virus and ensuing economic hardship that disproportionally affected Black Americans and brought issues of racism to the forefront of our national conversation.</p><p>At Clyde, we have always believed that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) should be a part of everything we do. We believe everybody deserves to feel safe, included, and supported at work. We stand in solitary with the Black community in the fight against injustice and we strive to be an actively anti-racist company.</p><p>We know that we have a long way to go.</p><p>We knew that in June, when we<a href="https://twitter.com/join_clyde/status/1269988640282890241/photo/1"> released a statement of support</a> for the Black Lives Matter movement and committed to recognizing how we’d failed to build a diverse team and what we were working to do about it.</p><p>Now, several months later, we want to continue that conversation and provide an update on how we think about diversity at Clyde. We want to share where we’re currently at when it comes to having and supporting a diverse team along with what we’re doing to support our DEI goals. We share this not to pat ourselves on the back or pretend like we’ve solved the problem. Rather, just the opposite—we recognize that the path towards having a truly diverse and inclusive workplace is a long one, and we want to be as transparent about where we are along it as we can be. We believe that will help us hold ourselves accountable, help our community see where we stand, and allow us to get the feedback we need to keep evolving.</p><p>So here’s where we are.</p><p>At Clyde, our core set of values include being thoughtful, listening with empathy, and facilitating collaboration. Those values inspire our DEI vision, which is <strong>to intentionally build a team that is as representative as possible of what our country looks like and to make sure that each team member feels supported, included, and enabled to shape the future of Clyde.</strong></p><p>We don’t see diversity as a check-the-box goal, but rather as what will make our team, our products, and our service the best they can possibly be.</p><p>Here’s what our team current looks like:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We currently have a <strong>30-person team</strong></li><li>As a whole, <strong>33% </strong>of our team are women and <strong>23% </strong>of our team<strong> </strong>identify as being people of color</li></ul><ul><li><strong>13% </strong>identify as Hispanic</li><li><strong>7% </strong>identify as Asian</li><li><strong>3% </strong>identify as Black</li></ul><ul><li>When it comes to management roles, we have an <strong>11-person team</strong></li></ul><ul><li>Women make up <strong>45% </strong>of that team</li><li>People of color make up <strong>18%</strong> of that team; all are Asian</li></ul><ul><li>When it comes to technical roles, we have an <strong>11-person team</strong></li></ul><ul><li>Women make up <strong>18%</strong> of that team</li><li>People of color make up <strong>27% </strong>of that team; all are Hispanic</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the future, we plan to double down on our efforts to make Clyde a truly diverse team. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made so far, especially when it comes to the gender distribution of our team, but we know there’s a lot more we could be doing, particularly regarding racial distribution.</p><p>As a small startup with limited resources, we want to prioritize investing in three initiatives: <strong>diversifying our candidate pipeline</strong>, <strong>training our team on unconscious bias and building an anti-racist workplace</strong>, and <strong>providing generous benefits so our team can show up as their full selves at work and beyond</strong>.</p><p>We’re planning to almost double in size over the next year, and as we do that hiring, we will do it in a way that creates a team that is more representative of our country as a whole. Over the last year, we’ve been working with PowerToFly, a recruiting platform focused on bringing women and underrepresented minorities into technical roles, to help build a diverse candidate pipeline, and we’ve signed up to continue that work into the future.</p><p>We’ve partnered with PowerToFly and their Global Director of Diversity and Inclusion, Dionna Smith, on the training side, too. We set up several training sessions on unconscious bias, allyship, and anti-racism work a few weeks before George Floyd’s murder and had our first session the week after. That first session was a safe space for our team to come together, share how the news was affecting them, and learn how to support each other. We will continue these training sessions on a rolling basis so that each new hire will have a chance to attend them, along with current employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Clyde’s beginning, we knew that we wanted to create an inclusive environment and build a diverse team, and we knew that our benefits had to reflect those goals. To that end, Clyde offers a flexible time off policy, including unlimited PTO, which we have always encouraged employees to use not just for vacations but also for holidays and cultural traditions that are important to them and might not be public holidays in the U.S. Over the last few months, we’ve made sure our team knows that they can and should use that time to take care of their mental health and to spend time with causes that are important to them, including participating in protests and Election Day. We also offer gender-neutral policies for paternity leave, granting three months of paid time off to each employee and encouraging them to take it (and leading by example on that front—I recently had a son and took all of my paternity leave to spend time with my growing family).&nbsp;</p><p>We’ll be back periodically to share updates on how our DEI initiatives are going, how our team is growing, and what we’re learning along the way.</p><p>If you’re interested in joining our team, take a look at our open roles<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/company/about#jobs"> here</a>. We’d love to have you on board.</p><p><br></p>	Wed Sep 30 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jereme-holiman
Clyde's Executive Power Lunch With Alibaba's John Caplan	clydes-executive-power-lunch-with-alibabas-john-caplan	Clyde's Executive Power Lunch With Alibaba's John Caplan	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/601c0cc7d699300aff93650e_Executive%20Power%20Lunch%20-%20Option%204.jpg	<p>What does the world’s largest online B2B marketplace and the platform democratizing access to quality extended warranty programs for merchants and customers alike have in common?</p><p>Besides John Caplan, that is?<br></p><p>Both businesses are built on the backs of strong teams.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The strength of a team has never been more important for businesses in the eCommerce space. It’s an ideal time to be building an eCommerce business but the landscape remains decidedly competitive. For that reason, finding long-lasting success is impossible without a solid team.<br></p><p>For our first <strong>Executive Power Lunch</strong>, we brought together John Caplan, Clyde board member and Alibaba.com’s President of North America &amp; Europe and Brandon Gell, Clyde’s CEO and cofounder. The pair discussed the characteristics of a great team, how to build one through hiring, and how to lead one with your board and advisors.<br></p><p>Our own very Maddie Buras, Clyde’s Marketing Director, moderated the conversation, but if you couldn’t make it live, we’re here with a recap of what we talked about. And we’ll be having more of these conversations—from executive 1-on-1s to industry deep dives—including a behind-the-scenes look at Data Science on Tuesday, March 9th. Stay tuned to Clyde’s social channels and blog for more details in the coming weeks.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>The 3 requirements of a successful startup team</strong></h3><h4><strong>Be customer obsessed</strong><br></h4><p>At Alibaba, every employee, from a salesperson in Europe to an engineer in China to a product person in San Francisco, has to spend four hours a month interviewing customers and typing up what they’ve learned.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That first seemed like overkill—Alibaba has thousands of employees!—but then it made sense.&nbsp; Successful businesses are ones that deliver real value to customers.<br></p><p>“Literally every business that exists can spend more time on [customers],” said Brandon. Here are some ways Brandon and John talked about doing that:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Make sure your sales, marketing, and product teams are connected.</strong> “Hearing from customers their needs, and digesting and interpreting that input with the product organization to refine the marketing messages, can really help,” said John. “Sales folks having a seat at the table [is] a gift of actually being vocal about the value we're creating and providing real feedback.”</li><li><strong>Serve the unserved customers. </strong>Part of Clyde’s differentiator in the warranty space is because we serve two customers: merchants, which have long been the main customer of the industry, but also the end consumer, who has long had to deal with complicated claims processes. “But the real way that you deliver the most value to the market—which is how you win the market—is to actually...spend all your time focusing on what the consumer actually wants and what that consumer experience is like,” said Brandon. “For us at Clyde, that’s product.”</li></ul><div></div><p><br></p><h4><strong>Be inclusive and caring</strong><br></h4><p>Inclusivity at work can look like small, specific things, like John’s example of not using Zoom backgrounds in order to show his team the reality of his life (even if that includes his in-law walking in with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich during a meeting).&nbsp;<br></p><p>But it’s also about investing in processes that make inclusion the default and leading with a genuine sense of care. Some examples:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Ask for regular feedback. </strong>John shared that Alibaba’s HR leader has every new hire make a presentation after 90 days at the company about how the onboarding process can be made better for the next cohort of new hires. “If everyone is inventing with a goal towards caring, the outcome can be pretty great,” said John.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be transparent. </strong>The whole Clyde team saw the pitch deck used as we were raising our Series A, and that’s just a small example of making everyone feel included. “It really creates a team that is oriented around sticking around through successes and [failures],” said Brandon.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>No fake care. </strong>Regular town halls, new hire buddy systems, social justice initiatives—all of those are great ways to show your employees that you are there for them. But only if you actually mean it. “It’s not, ‘Oh, we’re supposed to care, what should we do?’” said John. “If you actually care, do the things that a caring person will do.”</li><li><strong>Make the space. </strong>Brandon’s cognizant of the openness that a communication tool like Slack can provide, and makes sure that more sensitive conversations—including ones about politics—don’t happen there in ways that make people feel excluded.<br></li></ul><h4><strong>Grow at the right pace</strong><br></h4><p>John has a simple rule for whether his teams can invest in expanding: if they’re growing at 100% year-over-year, sure thing. If not, not yet. “Companies sometimes grow too fast, or hire too many people,” he shared. Here’s how to figure out whether your team is right-sized or not:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Set KPIs on velocity and impact.</strong> If you double the size of your product team but you’re releasing the same amount of new products as before, what’s going on there? “It's about momentum, and not getting stuck in your scale to slow you down,” said John.</li><li><strong>Make sure that new people are caught up. </strong>Do your new hires know where you’ve been, where you’re going, and exactly how they fit in? “If not, you end up pulling instead of pushing,” said Brandon. “The only lever that I have or that any leadership has is making sure that our people are driving in the right direction.”</li><li><strong>Stay small enough to be agile. </strong>The content marketing team at Alibaba completely shifted how they did business during the pandemic, going from putting out a piece once a week to publishing new stories multiple times a day on everything from fundraising to change management. That was only possible, said John, because that team was small and could pivot immediately.</li></ul><div></div><h3>‍<br><strong>How to hire a great team</strong><br></h3><p>Before you can build a business through a strong team, you first have to staff it. How can you separate the okay-but-not-great candidates from the people who will truly drive your success? John and Brandon had a few ideas to share:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Look for values, not skills. </strong>Skills can be taught. Values can’t. That means looking for grit and determination first, and then seeing if they meet your other shared values like Alibaba’s “no smart jerks” policy (to weed out the people you wouldn’t want to sit next to on a long-haul flight to China) or their “trust makes everything simple” mantra.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Passion over product. </strong>Brandon was convinced that everyone he hired needed to be some kind of product person. Then he realized that he could live without a stable full of product superstars, but that he couldn’t live without a curious, passionate team. “I always ask, ‘What are you doing, what are you reading, what are you listening to?’ If the answer is ‘I’m not doing anything, I just want to make money,’ it’s like ‘Okay, you’re probably not the right person,’” said Brandon, who is looking instead for natural curiosity, even if on a subject he knows nothing about (see: heavy metal).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Set a process. </strong>“If you’re not organized going in, what you get coming out is not really going to work,” John said. For his team, that means doing team interviews with four or five interviewers, each measuring something different.</li><li><strong>Reference checks are crucial. </strong>“Even when someone is reluctant—people just want to say nice things—that’s one area to probe and find out,” said John.&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div><p><br></p><h3><strong>On leading a company authentically</strong><br></h3><p>“What you think building a company is, and the reality of building a company, are two different things,” said John. It’s not all high-stakes coding and legal battles in well-appointed conference rooms (or whatever else <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYEAqq0ReZA"><em>The Social Network</em></a><em> </em>implied).&nbsp;<br></p><p>To lead well, CEOs need strong teams, as we’ve discussed. But that goes not just for their employees, but for their boards and their advisors, too. “The role of the board is to provide support to the leadership team,” said John. “It seems sort of basic, but it’s just to ask questions and have a conversation in an incredibly safe way.”<br></p><p>John, who calls himself an almost-unemployable lifelong entrepreneur, had three pieces of advice for CEOs starting out. Even if you’re not fortunate enough to have him on your board, we’re happy to share those with anyone else trying to build something cool:<br></p><ol><li><strong>Focus on customers.</strong></li><li><strong>Be your authentic self.</strong></li><li><strong>Operate like your pants are on fire.</strong><br></li></ol><p>If you can do all of that, he said—if you can be “a joyful warrior building your business”—then you can get through anything, including a year of economic uncertainty, COVID, and social unrest. You, too, can be, as John said so well, “A customer-centric island of goodness and a great place for the humans that gather there on this noble mission.”</p><p><br></p><p>For a full recording of our webinar, <a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/building-strong-retail-teams.html">click here</a>. <br><br></p>	Thu Feb 04 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
Clyde's Origin Story	clydes-origin-story	Clyde's Origin Story	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc9f947a7f51b546368299a_arthur-marshall-733812-unsplash.jpg	<h3 data-w-id="a8449604-1642-81c1-b894-2604509033ee">How We Found the First Problems We Tackled </h3><p data-w-id="cce687c4-f003-4492-2091-074b99f98b96">Clyde was founded out of necessity. In 2017 I was working at a small hardware startup that saw an opportunity to better serve customers by offering a warranty program. Customers wanted coverage options but didn’t know where to begin. I took on research and development of a program that would fit the needs of our success team and provide our customers some security along with their purchases. The experience that follows became the driving force of Clyde's mandate - put retailers first.<br data-w-id="fe7cd0ab-6d27-fa94-1a37-8fbb8dd0834b"></p><p data-w-id="77db4e9b-051d-bb80-cfc3-41fb88394a4d">As was the case for many retailers back then, my search for product protection unearthed more challenges than solutions.<br data-w-id="4443dc3c-7d00-d020-4b85-6a705ca7eb40"></p><p data-w-id="60f5c04a-aa21-2cef-cdcf-32a9e0afdfcd">We ran the numbers on self-insuring our product and quickly realized that kind of risk exposure was out of the question for an independent merchant. The company didn’t have the balance sheet, internal tools, or bandwidth to stand up a new product line, certainly not in an industry that none of us had experience in.<br data-w-id="321d1dfc-d8c6-18ac-9dca-8913096ae238"></p><p data-w-id="7c21566f-99fa-cd14-b3bd-27e30bae1b6b">No problem, I thought – we’ll work with a name brand insurer.<br data-w-id="39af9b98-897e-980a-0607-94ce6106a66d"></p><p data-w-id="aa0648c6-0fb8-8860-7352-2799a148d976">While looking for product protection, I also oversaw our Stripe integration. The contrast between these two experiences was striking. If integrations for financial transactions could be so easy, where were the insurance solutions? There ought to be a way to do this. &nbsp;<br data-w-id="ea052d1a-ec71-d7bd-81e3-c2ec3c5a15e0"></p><p data-w-id="b06a76cc-e1a8-8015-83c6-2021c7136128">We pressed on. We reached out to every name brand insurer we could find. We failed to get a response - let alone a meaningful conversation. ‘Demo’ seemed to be a foreign word in the industry. I began to question whether insurers had the tools to support retailers, any retailers – mid-size or enterprise.<br data-w-id="ccdb85f0-abd6-1821-c4c7-805c41ab1020"></p><p data-w-id="d1715a87-6a1e-fc93-8d1b-96a7cd3ae0b9">Finally, I gained footholds. We booked conversations with one big name, as well as a smaller, local insurer. The discussions lasted months. Eventually the large insurer told us that they do not work with business earning less than $500M annually. The local insurer was more willing. But their integration and claims processes were disenchanting at best. My search bottomed out. And the business went on without product protection.<br data-w-id="b97ba72f-168d-1409-fc66-3504a8df87a1"></p><p data-w-id="e92696d8-d963-9d1c-1272-d14c29ebf42f">I continued thinking there ought to be a way to close this gap between market need and supply. That experience founded Clyde.</p><p data-w-id="27dba9e8-7a0b-fa33-6607-c934b34251bf">The business case that would become our company revolved around meeting those ought-to moments. Merchants ought to have access to product insurance, regardless of size. There ought to be a solution that eases the path to adoption - rather than force overly technical integrations. That solution ought to give end users real assurance in their purchase. By combining technology, data, and partnerships, the insurance industry could be democratized. <em data-w-id="70bb16a2-d844-8b82-9a02-4c1beafab535">Everyone</em> - small, midsize and enterprise - could access warranty programs in a box. After three months of validation and late nights spent refining, I incorporated Clyde.</p>	Thu Apr 25 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	brandon-gell
Clyde's Partner Program Is Helping Retailers Thoughtfully Scale Their Tech Stacks	clydes-partner-program-is-helping-retailers-thoughtfully-scale-their-tech-stacks	Clyde's Partner Program Is Helping Retailers Thoughtfully Scale Their Tech Stacks	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60be259db06996c2b548d39a_Clyde_Partner_LinkedIn.png	<p>Clyde is excited to announced today its new partnership program.

This is how we can consistently deliver shared value to our customer base.”<br></p><p>Clyde’s CEO, Brandon Gell, views this partnership launch as a meaningful step in the company’s growth story. “We’re in the business of solving problems and providing value to our merchants in any way that we can.

Commerce Chats: Kate Albers	commerce-chats-kate-albers	Commerce Chats: Kate Albers, eCommerce Manager, Chili 	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f36cb919bfe19bd4662525d_E-Commerce%20Chats-%20Opt%201.png	<p>At Clyde, we chat with retail and eCommerce leaders everyday about how they are growing their businesses and improving the customer experience. We recently spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kralbers">Kate Albers</a>, eCommerce Manager at sleep tech company <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com">Chili</a>, about her priorities and initiatives, as well as her advice to retailers looking to make the move into eCommerce.</p><h3>1. Hi Kate. We’re interested to hear how you got into e-commerce.</h3><p>I actually entered e-commerce from the agency, not brand, side. Though my background was originally in public relations and publishing, I knew the future was in the immediate consumer satisfaction of digital marketing. I worked for a digital marketing and ad agency working with many clients across all verticals. After managing social paid media, I needed to see what happens “under-the-car-hood.” Therefore, I moved to the brand side in 2017 and have been with Kryo Inc.’s Chili brand ever since.<br></p><h3>2. Tell us a bit about Chili. What projects or initiatives are you focused on at Chili right now? What are some of the most impactful things you've implemented over the last year that's best prepared you for today's retail environment?</h3><p>Chili, a brand of Kryo Inc., is all about changing the way the world sleeps. For years, we’ve been told it’s all about getting the right number of hours of sleep or even about mattress comfort. But at Chili, we’re instead focused on delivering science-backed sleep solutions specifically tied to sleep <em>quality</em>. The way we do that is through effectively managing sleep temperature.&nbsp;</p><p>In all things, we strive to meet our customers where they are. That’s why in the past year, we’ve rolled out text-message marketing, a sleep-solution quiz, cross-sells in the cart and even our own front-facing philanthropic program called Kryo Cares.<br></p><h3>3. What tools or strategies do you find most meaningful for improving the e-commerce customer experience?</h3><p>We’re always striving to turn our customers into our biggest supporters. It’s cliché, but there truly is nothing more powerful that delivering an amazing customer experience. That effort will always result in the best return in investment. We’ve achieved this strategy in many ways, from providing personalization on our website to product attachments in the cart to fun giveaways.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>4. When you were evaluating Clyde, what other projects were you considering putting on your plate, and what made you prioritize Clyde?&nbsp;</h3><p>At a small company or start up there are always a lot of projects, but Clyde became a clear priority 1) because it improved our customer’s buying experience and 2) because it has had real revenue impacts for us as a start-up. While we always put our customers number one, and number two also helps drive our mission forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>5. We’re inspired to see how many retailers have contributed to COVID-19 relief efforts. Tell us about Chili’s “Kryo Cares one-for-one program”.</p><p>Absolutely. So I mentioned about meeting your customers where they are, and unfortunately in 2020 this has meant in a COVID-19 pandemic. While we as a business had already worked with veteran’s groups and local charities for years, we were determined to use those initial efforts as a launchpad to help even more essential workers and healthcare responders this year.<br></p><p>That’s why we launched our <a href="https://www.chilitechnology.com/pages/kryocares">Kryo Cares one-for-one program</a> this past March. When customers purchased one of our dual-zone sleep systems, we’ve been able to donate a single-zone system to a first responder or health professional in need of a great night’s sleep. It essentially means our customers are able to shop for good and allow us the support to give to those who need help. We’ve donated over $300,000 worth of sleep systems to date and plan to donate up to one million dollars worth of sleep systems to our current applicant pool.</p><h3>6. Any advice for brick-and-mortar retailers looking to transition into e-commerce?<br></h3><p>You can do it. Read that again.</p><p>It will seem tough and overwhelming at first, and there will be a lot of new technology to learn but keep driving forward. E-commerce was built to be “easy” for both the brand and consumer. Start by simply setting up your online storefront. Then, start driving traffic to your site. Once you have that foundation, you can take it from there.<br></p><h3>7. One last question. We assume you know a little something about unwinding, working at a sleep tech company. Any tips for staying sane during this work from home time?</h3><p>&nbsp;A lot of people smarter than me have said, “Make a list of five to ten things that matter to you about whatever you’re trying to do. If it’s not on that list, don’t give it all of your energy.” When I want to fall asleep, I make my fall asleep list, which may mean I read instead of binge watching Curb Your Enthusiasm. It’s tough but it works.</p><p>&nbsp;I’ve found this idea works for other areas of life too, like I’m recently learning to surf, but worrying about sharks isn’t on that list — and thank goodness.</p><p><br></p>	Mon Aug 17 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	maddie-buras
Comparison Guide: 7 Best Warranty Management Software Tools For Businesses in 2021	comparison-guide-7-best-warranty-management-software-tools-for-businesses-in-2021	Comparison Guide: 7 Best Warranty Management Software Tools For Businesses in 2021	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6197e527d83e244996ba241b_7%20Best%20Warranty%20Management%20Tools%20Artwork%205.jpg	<p>Whatever you’re selling, and whatever platform you’re selling it on, there are thousands of tools, programs, and plug-ins to make your life as an eComm retailer easier. Inventory management. Accounting. Marketing.</p><p>And warranties, too.</p><p>Offering <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection">extended warranties or product protection</a> to your customers creates trust, loyalty, and additional margin opportunities.</p><p>But which warranty tool is right for you?</p><p>Here, we’ll look at TK top warranty programs so you can figure out which is the best for you and your business.</p><h2>What Does Warranty Management Software Do?</h2><p>Warranty management software does what it sounds like: manages warranties.<br></p><p>But what does that mean, practically?<br></p><p>It offers an add-on insurance option to products that you sell, and then administers the execution of that program.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Per <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/07/29/2271039/0/en/U-S-Extended-Warranty-Market-to-Reach-59-52-Billion-By-2028-AMR.html">Allied Market Research</a>, it’s a growing field that’s expected to reach $59.5 billion by 2028, especially in the wake of the pandemic, which has led consumers to realize the risk that unforeseen situations can have on their lives. Accident protection is the fastest-growing segment of warranty plans, and while warranties have been traditionally popular with big-ticket items like cars and houses, industry analysts expect those trends to continue for personal technology and other purchases.<br></p><p>Retailers can get on that growth—and that extra margin—by offering an extended warranty program through a partner.<br></p><p>And consumers end up benefiting, too, since a more <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-warranty-claims-management-is-becoming-more-customer-centric">customer-centric warranty program</a> can improve their peace of mind about a purchase and cover them if anything happens.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Features to Look For In Great Warranty Management Tools</h2><p>You’ve got a lot to consider when <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/7-things-to-consider-for-warranty-programs">evaluating extended warranty programs</a>, including:</p><h3>Automatic catalog matching</h3><p>For every product you sell that you want to offer a warranty on, you’ll need to get coverage. The software you choose should either be an independent claims administrator themselves or partner with an insurer, and it should automatically match your catalog to contracts so that you can be up and running with no manual implementation needed.</p><h3>Integration with your sales platform</h3><p>You’ll want your extended warranty options to pop up alongside product pages or as add-ons at check-out, so your ideal warranty management tool would integrate with your Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce, Salesforce, or other sales site.</p><h3>Smart pricing</h3><p>How much should you sell your product protection plans for? Ideally, you won’t have to figure that out on your own. Choose a partner that offers anonymized data from similar types of products and can automatically suggest prices that make sense for what you’re selling—and adjusts those prices over time as it gathers data about your specific customer base and what they’re spending.</p><h3>Customization and personalization</h3><p>Customers buy more with brands they trust, and shoehorning in a product protection CTA that doesn’t look or sound like your brand is likely to work. Look for a warranty tool that allows you to create unique CTAs with your logo, color scheme, font, and copy (but do keep in mind there are some legal requirements to exactly what you can say). Bonus points if you can include CTAs at multiple stops in the purchase process, from pop-ups to modals.</p><h3>Flexibility</h3><p>Before you sign on the dotted line, look into whether your warranty partner is asking for a long-term contract or an exclusivity clause. You’ll want to retain your flexibility to find the partner that’s best for you, which may mean switching partners if you’re not getting the level of service and support that you need.</p><h3>Comprehensive reporting and analytics&nbsp;</h3><p>Just like any other part of your business, you’ll want to see how your purchase protection offerings are performing! Make sure your chosen tool comes with customizable dashboards where you can track contracts sold, product value covered, contract revenue earned, and profit.</p><h3>Real, live support</h3><p>Fingers crossed that your product protection program goes off without a hitch from day one. But in case it doesn’t—or in case you have questions, want to learn more, or think of ways to improve the integration—you’ll want to be able to talk to a responsive, knowledgeable team. Look for flexible options, from chat to phone to video, and make sure you’re comfortable with their SLA.</p><h2>7 Warranty Management Software Tools</h2><h3>1) Clyde&nbsp;</h3><p>Hello—fancy seeing you here.

Consumer Electronics Holiday Gift Guide: Our 16 Top Picks	consumer-electronics-holiday-gift-guide-our-16-top-picks	Consumer Electronics Holiday Gift Guide: Our 16 Top Picks	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fad946eef38311d019967f1_Consumer%20Electronics%20Holiday%20Gift%20Guide_%20Our%2016%20Top%20Picks.png	<p><br></p><p>The holidays are coming (cue the Mariah Carey) and they’re looking a little different this year. Gone is the risk of getting trampled at an in-person Black Friday frenzy, but also gone is the chance to gather around with lots of extended family and friends and enjoy time together.<br></p><p>That’s why we’re leaning towards gifting electronics this holiday season—they’re easy to find, simple to ship, one-size-fits-all, and useful. So long as we’re stuck socially distancing, we’re fans of making that time as comfortable, connected, and celebratory as possible.<br></p><p>This guide is broken up into sections by price. We thought about doing it by personality or interests—gamers, chefs, creative types—but then we realized that since we’re all spending all our time at home anyways, the most important criteria is that the gifts be useful, fun, and within budget. Six-plus months of social distancing have turned me into a gamer, a chef, and a creative, after all.<br></p><h3>Onto those budgets:<br></h3><p><strong>1. Best gifts under $25</strong></p><p><strong>2. Best gifts under $50</strong></p><p><strong>3. Best gifts under $150</strong></p><p><strong>4.

Cyber Week Shatters Records, Attachment Rates Trend Higher	cyber-week-shatters-record-attachment-rates-trend-higher	Cyber Week Shatters Records, Attachment Rates Trend Higher	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fc93c7d8ac8518055b3b22f_Cyber-Week-Artwork-Blog-Post.png	<p>All eyes turned to Cyber Week as economists and retail experts projected historic numbers in purchases, shipments, and retail revenue. The consumer-spendathon also took on outsized importance this year given its potential to provide a springboard for the overall economy. In years past, sluggish Cyber Week numbers have been a precursor to an economic slowdown. Conversely, record-shattering spending during Cyber Week has helped <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/29/investing/stocks-2017-wall-street/index.html">kickstart the economy</a> in previous cycles.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now that the dust has settled, it appears that despite an onslaught of special offers, discounts and incentives provided by national retailers in the past six weeks to compete with Amazon’s Prime Day, Cyber Week’s traditional allure was too much for consumers to pass up. Here’s a quick “By The Numbers” recap of Cyber Week:<br></p><p>Cyber Week Domestic Spending <strong>($106.5 Billion, Up 27.7% YoY)</strong></p><p>Cyber Week Shopper Participation <strong>(186 Million, Up 22% YoY)</strong></p><p>Black Friday <strong>($8 Billion, Up 21.6% YoY)</strong></p><p>Small Business Saturday <strong>($4.7 Billion, Up 30.2% YoY)</strong></p><p>Cyber Monday <strong>($10.8 Billion, Up 15.1% YoY)</strong></p><p>Smartphones Accounted For <strong>37%</strong> of all Cyber Monday Sales<br></p><p>*Data Powered By <a href="https://www.adobe.com/special/retail-shopping-insights/">Adobe Retail Shopping Insights</a> &amp; <a href="https://nrf.com/">The National Retail Federation</a><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l14y39OUXbk"></iframe></div></figure><h3><strong>Savvy Retailers Providing Flexible Options</strong><br></h3><p>The migration from traditional in-store shopping to an online experience is far from new. For the past fifteen years consumer reports have tracked a steady 1.5% to 2.5% year-over-year increase in online shopping volume. During this year’s Cyber Week, those marginal annual increases were completely obliterated as shoppers took their business in droves online. According to <a href="https://retailnext.net/en/home/">RetailNext</a>, a leading data provider of in-store analytics, traffic numbers for brick and mortar stores were down 42.3% for the weekend (Friday through Sunday). Yet 22% more shoppers participated in Cyber Week 2020 than in the previous year. While this tectonic shift from in-person to online was predicted, retailers that offered hybrid shopping models actually fared considerably better than those without in-person options.&nbsp;<br></p><p><em>Revolution ROI reported on Wednesday that “US retailers offering </em><a href="https://www.parcelpending.com/blog/what-is-bopis-in-retail/"><em>BOPIS</em></a><em> and curbside pickup increased digital revenue by 29% compared to 20% for retailers without these options.”</em><br></p><p>In a competitive online landscape, differentiators like flexible pickup options are becoming&nbsp; increasingly important. Both the USPS and leading domestic shippers have warned that the second half of December will be fraught with shipping delays. As a result, shoppers are seeking out retailers with in-person and curbside pickup options as a means of circumventing costly and potentially delayed shipping options. “Throughout the remainder of the holiday season, we expect to see record sales continue and curbside pickup to gain even more momentum as shoppers avoid crowds and potential shipping delays,” said Taylor Schreiner, a director at Adobe Digital Insights.<br>‍</p><h3>‍<strong>Attachment Rates Soar, Small Business Saturday Shines</strong>‍</h3><p>Clyde’s internal data revealed two promising trends within the warranty space. That first was that overall attachment rates soared during Cyber Week, experiencing a 134% year-over-year increase. The attachment rate is simply the percentage of product sales transactions that include a service contract at the point of sale.<br></p><p>Our data also found that Small Business Saturday, once considered the plucky underdog of Cyber Week, accounted for 22% of all warranties sold. That figure was second only to Cyber Monday, which accounted for 27% of contracts sold during the week.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In the lead up to Cyber Week, industry analysts stressed the importance of free shipping. According to CNBC, nearly 40% of all “abandoned carts” were traced back to consumers' unwillingness to pay for shipping costs. Similarly, The NPD Group, an international retail tracking leader, indicated in their annual <a href="https://www.npd.com/perspectives/us-cross-industry-holiday-purchase-intentions-lp/">Holiday Shopping Season Report</a> that “41% of consumers cited free shipping as something that would influence where they shop for holiday gifts, <strong>surpassing special sale price</strong> as the top influencer for the first time.” These tangible cost-savings may also explain an increased willingness by consumers to purchase warranties. With Cyber Week now in the books, Clyde's internal data reveals the potential connection between free shipping and increased protection plan spending. As a company, Clyde sold seven times more warranties on purchases offering free shipping than those that did not.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our data team will continue to monitor trends throughout the holiday, specifically new consumer trends that may impact attachment rates and warranty length preferences. Be sure to check back to our website for blogs, webinars and podcasts discussing these topics in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br></p>	Fri Dec 04 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

eCommerce Industries Projected To Grow The Most	ecommerce-industries-projected-to-grow-the-most	eCommerce Industries Projected To Grow The Most	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/617aca75ec8e9936b785fe42_The%20pandemic%20has%20created%20new%20e-commerce%20niches%E2%80%94are%20they%20here%20to%20stay_.jpg	<p>The rise of affordable and easily available smart devices has had a huge impact on the way the global economy functions. These days, most people—whether they’re located in the United States, China, Europe, or elsewhere—have easy access to the internet with just a tap of a phone, watch, or computer key, and it’s shifting the way they communicate, work, play, and shop.</p><p>For an example of how technological advances have helped to shape the global economy, just think back to the early days and picture what the e-commerce landscape looked like on the web. Rudimentary tools, slow connections, and data limitations made it tough to navigate shopping sites, but as the technology has grown and been refined, so has the experience with online shopping.</p><p>Many of us now turn to the internet for most of our shopping needs. Every item—whether it’s fashion apparel, shoes, toys, electronics, media, hobby, and tools for DIY projects—is available on the web. They’re all quick and easy to access thanks to huge e-commerce sites like Amazon, Zappos, Walmart, Crate &amp; Barrel, Wayfair, Overstock, and others.</p><p>It’s hardly just American companies that are capitalizing on the rise of e-commerce shopping, however. China has already managed to capture one of the largest segments of the e-commerce market—and is likely to continue to grow its presence significantly in the next five years. The e-commerce landscape is also expected to grow significantly in the coming years, with the total revenue projected to be about $4.2 trillion by 2025. But which industries are poised to capture more of the revenue as the landscape continues to change shape?</p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Clyde</a> reviewed data from Statista in order to break down the main five e-commerce industry segments—fashion; electronics and media; toys, hobby, and DIY; furniture and appliances; and food and personal care—and discuss how much each will grow in the next five years, the effect of the coronavirus on businesses in those segments, and the forces shaping the future of e-commerce worldwide. The market segments were ranked based on the total projected growth over the next five years—up to 2025.</p><h3>Did You Know?</h3><p>Clyde offers a wide range of <a href="http://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection">product warranties</a> that can cater to any industry. That includes industries like Consumer Electronics, Jewelry, Furniture, Sporting Equipment, and much more.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/617aca866351634f6589e31c_ou4SWzOHEgb0Q23nUihvvpuzEorROTjuDTQIA_JrZWwxPgVYt3QPGdxSKiuM55jmTJlGoJ9SfMHW0zxHMu_2mzZzEbWiDr_ipcMTyuIXe8ISshbYoRVUJgXnPXNgegMk039Mu4Ou.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>#5 Electronics &amp; Media</strong></h2><p>- 2020 revenue: $600.5B</p><p>- 2025 projected revenue: $773.9B</p><p>- Projected growth: 28.88%</p><p>It’s no secret customers like to compare reviews, features, and other factors before buying high-cost electronics such as laptops, TVs, and desktop computers, and the desire to get educated on the ins and outs of the products being considered is precisely what has helped to drive the growth in electronics and media e-commerce—especially during the height of the pandemic. By shopping online for these high-priced items, customers were able to avoid the risks of in-person shopping and take the time necessary to compare the products and user reviews while getting access to more product options than are typically found in a big box store.</p><p>The listings on e-commerce sites offer detailed product information, insight into performance and functionality, and in many cases user reviews, which allow shoppers to gather more insight into the products than they’d otherwise get. The ability to compare prices is also a huge draw, as shoppers are often able to get the best deals on these costly items by simply browsing different e-commerce sites to find the lowest prices. Plus, most large retailers now offer extremely short delivery times for these large items, which makes it even easier to shop for expensive electronics and media online. In many cases, these items ship quickly and free of charge, making it easy for busy shoppers to snag deals and receive their items just a few days after purchasing them.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/617aca865158747c7af7ae02_u9yBpw7XTRgwO0j205PGSal9Bd_7GDCNQVv2m58e-_9HE6sCXVS4N0n-YPSf7zn3ox2mwlK2cv8vaXSh0yvt3e7cXdP0fPYDb1i-jlj3XHT-MInnhQHXQ6Px44kqJi4fyBo0PKiZ.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>#4 Furniture &amp; Appliances</strong></h2><p>- 2020 revenue: $383.2B</p><p>- 2025 projected revenue: $521.9B</p><p>- Projected growth: 36.20%</p><p>Shopping for furniture and appliances in stores wasn’t just tough to do during the height of the pandemic when stores were closed across the nation, but it can be time-consuming, as each store offers different products and different deals, which typically means you have to visit multiple stores to find the right items. The benefit of e-commerce sites for furniture and appliance purchases is shoppers can get easy access to a wide range of choices with just a click of the mouse. They can also get a high level of personalization thanks to sophisticated e-commerce features that let them tailor their shopping experiences to their preferences. That’s part of why furniture and appliance e-commerce has exploded in growth recently and is projected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years, too.</p><p>Other unique e-commerce features—such as virtual reality, which lets shoppers “try on” that new gas stove in their kitchens or fit the new armchair into their living rooms—have helped consumers quickly adapt to this new way of furniture and appliance shopping. Virtual reality offers a feature that isn’t readily available in brick-and-mortar stores. As with other large purchases, the ability to price compare and find the best deals on everything from microwaves to refrigerators, mattresses, lamps, decor, and even vacuums is another driving factor behind the growth of e-commerce shopping in this industry and is likely to continue to propel the growth in revenue over the long term.</p><h4>Trending</h4><p>An exceptional customer experience starts with the first purchase.

This is especially true for shoppers looking for certain hard-to-find hobby or collectible items, which aren’t typically available in brick-and-mortar stores, but are easily accessible via online marketplaces built for niche products. Other unique e-commerce perks, like trustworthy product reviews and price comparison tools, are also a draw for buyers who want to make informed choices. This is especially true when it comes to DIY products, like tools for gardening or barbecue equipment, which were in high demand at the height of lockdowns during the pandemic.</p><p>The wide range of available products also plays a part in driving shoppers to e-commerce sites for toys, hobby, and DIY purchases. For example, buyers looking for sportsmen gear typically want to choose from a wide range of choices to fit their needs, and it’s common for these shoppers to want access to certain brands or products. It’s not easy to find a brick-and-mortar store that carries all the brands in the market, but it’s simple to find the desired products and brands online, given that there are no stockroom or floor space limitations for inventory.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/617aca869f37233b7071b8ac_3Lq3ETWhSPs0F1Em3_h1GA-3HGERV_0LlULBKPBfTyuQDvrsaJvKb8Io9WaWLvYmb2INJ2PJIuelvo6h7FCb0rSH5VFTy8GGye8dFyYEjpDdNNWKTtfYxZoRaLDHxjh_Qmw-d5iS.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>#2 Fashion</strong></h2><p>- 2020 revenue: $752.5B</p><p>- 2025 projected revenue: $1164.7B</p><p>- Projected growth: 54.78%</p><p>The fashion e-commerce industry actually experienced a downturn during the first part of 2020, likely due, at least in part, to lockdowns and job closures cutting the need for new clothing items. But this e-commerce industry bounced back and then grew by a whopping 14% when compared to pre-coronavirus trends. This segment of e-commerce, which includes apparel items, shoes, bags, and accessories, is popular among shoppers—and U.S. shoppers in particular, who spend the most money on apparel. E-commerce offers a new kind of shopping experience for fashion, including a broader product range, free shipping, same-day delivery, and hassle-free return processes, which are major perks for buyers looking for fashion items online.</p><p>Other factors—like a curated shopping experience that takes into account previous purchases and browsing history to offer personalized suggestions—or services where individual outfits are put together by personal style advisers have only added to the online clothes shopping experience. Interestingly social media influencers have also played a significant role in the rise of online fashion retail popularity. Whether a fashion blog or a social media platform, these digital influences are able to reach huge audiences. Product placement has also helped to grow fashion e-commerce at unprecedented speeds.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/617aca865aea73f6b02c3c79_jb02CtnXouBNejGdKtAFGblPxMLDKiVz138tdBdQF_n61dCgjuJD0OLj67sOYL-CW1BRnmjgEO9t09hEBPRGDEmQ4x_kopJtxjGy-gHKerOooIo0YKbnj2kmoyrFJ4go1RkOFVuR.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>#1 Food and personal care</strong></h2><p>- 2020 revenue: $482.1B</p><p>- 2025 projected revenue: $791.6B</p><p>- Projected growth: 64.20%</p><p>The fastest-growing segment of e-commerce is food and personal care, and it’s due in major part to the pandemic, which caused online sales of groceries and personal hygiene items to surge as social distancing rules were implemented across the nation. But the pandemic isn’t the only draw of shopping for food and personal care items online. One of the main factors driving the growth of food and personal care e-commerce is that online shoppers can save time and avoid crowded stores by using online pharmacies, drugstores, or grocery stores that offer home delivery—while getting access to a wide selection of products and brands that may not be available in regional brick-and-mortar shops.</p><p>The option to set recurring purchase fulfillment, like monthly or bi-monthly delivery of medications, vitamins, deodorant, or other personal care items, has also helped to drive interest in this industry as customers look for ways to fill their ongoing shopping needs quickly and easily. Competitive prices have also helped drive consumer interest in e-commerce food and personal care purchases, but it’s also important to note the fresh food e-commerce industry is still in its infancy. There is still significant room to grow as the industry refines processes for delivering easily damaged items like fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meats to consumers who shop online for their groceries. The e-commerce food and personal care industry is expected to grow significantly for that reason alone, as e-retailers figure out how to seamlessly fill the needs of online shoppers looking for these types of items.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Photos courtesy Shutterstock users: Ivan Kruk, Sirtravelalot, Ventura, Sevenke, Farknot Architect and McLittle Stock</em><br></p>	Mon Oct 25 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	angelica-leicht
Educated Consumers Spend More	educated-consumers-spend-more	Educated Consumers Spend More	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e33524ab50298bbde86c291_200129_Willingness-09.png	<p>In our latest white paper, we discuss the effects of product protection on consumer confidence and willingness to pay.</p><p>There is not an abundance of data driven information available to the retail community regarding extended warranties, accident protection, and the effects these offerings have on a retailer’s most valuable asset: their customers.</p><h3>Consumers Are Becoming More Educated&nbsp;<br></h3><p>Until recently, offering extended warranties to the consumer was something accessible only to the largest of retailers, brand manufacturers, and the automobile industry. What little exposure the majority of retailers have to extended warranties is heavily influenced by the experience consumers have had with these big-box, in-store, profit-rich environments¹. Opinion editorial content on the subject of extended warranties often villainizes the service as “expensive” and “not worth it.”&nbsp;</p><p>However, research shows that still one third of consumers today choose to purchase an extended warranty or accident protection. Moreover, this same research found that attachment rates had a positive correlation with consumers’ familiarity with extended warranties and how they work (Wolf, 2017).</p><p>Running product protection programs have traditionally been a resource intensive endeavor with very little to no technological or operational efficiencies in place. The extended warranty program of old is also fraught with negative customer experiences. With rapidly rising minimum expectations for their shopping experiences, consumers today are more educated than ever.</p><p>Rather than categorically identifying product protection plans as poor purchase decisions for consumers, the data indicates that consumers are becoming more educated in both the quality and applicability of protection plans for their purchases, leading to higher confidence levels and higher willingness to pay when making purchasing decisions.</p><h3>Offering Product Protection Increases Willingness to Pay</h3><p>We combined qualitative and quantitative observations from transactional history over a five month period where consumers were given the opportunity to add product protection to their purchase at the point of sale.&nbsp;</p><p>We collected transactions over 42,500 eligible products sold by 48 retailers over a five-month period. The average price for the 40,000 products purchased without a protection plan was $269.24, whereas the average price for the 2,500 similar products purchased with a protection plan was 38.8% higher, averaging $373.74 in value.&nbsp;</p><p>Over this same time period, we have experienced shoppers asking which stores offer protection plans for the type of product(s) they were looking to buy. These consumers expressed their intention to purchase a product at a higher base price from the retailer offering product protection than a lower price from a retailer not offering product protection.</p><p>We are not insinuating that all consumers who buy protection plans are educated shoppers; however, we are noting that self-identified, educated buyers have expressed their appreciation for extended warranties and accident protection when offered.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><p>Without purchase history from retailers prior to offering protection plans through Clyde, it’s difficult to identify causation with regards to the effects of offering product protection on consumer confidence and willingness to pay. What we can clearly identify, however, is that consumers have an increased willingness to pay for products when purchasing product protection plans, as demonstrated by substantial increases in average product value and customer feedback.</p><p>Furthermore, we conclude that advances in previously technologically disadvantaged sectors support the theory that better processes and technology, as well as consistently accessible and accurate information, lead to better customer experiences.</p><p>This level of customer service was not an option in the recent past of the extended warranty industry. Today, services like Clyde offer retailers the ability to seamlessly integrate software, processes, and accredited insurers to offer their consumers product protection and, ultimately, a better buying experience.</p><p>You can download the full white paper <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/lp/educated-consumers-spend-more">here</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>[1] Analysis in the US shows extended warranties accounted for almost half of BestBuy’s operating income in 2003, and that profit margins on warranties ranged from 50% to 60% (“The Warranty Windfall,” Business Week (December 19, 2004)). <em>Warranty Week </em>2005a shows that Ford and Dell each brought in more than $1 billion a year through the sale of extended warranties in 2005. Dell’s extended warranty revenue as a percentage of operating income sales rose from 24% in 2003 to 38% in 2005 (<em>Warranty Week </em>2005b).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	Fri Jan 31 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	maddie-buras

Everything SMBs Need to Know About Warranty Programs: A Q&A with Clyde’s Pam Schneider	everything-smbs-need-to-know-about-warranty-programs-a-q-a-with-clydes-pam-schneider	Everything SMBs Need to Know About Warranty Programs: A Q&A with Clyde’s Pam Schneider	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6126876774bc5fd27470a429_Clyde%20Q%26A%20Artwork%204.png	<p>Small and medium-sized businesses tend to be helmed by jacks of many trades.<br></p><p>Successful business owners need to have a certain level of comfort with a range of fields: sales, marketing, and finance, at least, and probably HR, legal, and supply chain management, too.<br></p><p>They’re used to figuring things out on the ground. They’re often self-taught, self-made leaders who aren’t afraid to move quickly and break things along the way.<br></p><p>That works with marketing. That might even work with finance. But when it comes to legal and compliance projects, it’s usually worth it for SMBs to look for a partner.<br></p><p>We asked Clyde’s VP of Warranty, Pam Schneider, who has been in insurance for 25 years and warranties for nearly 10, to tell us everything she’d want an SMB considering a warranty program to know.<br></p><p>And then we wrote it all down here for you.&nbsp;</p><h2>8 questions with Clyde’s Pam Schneider</h2><h3>What have you seen in terms of how SMBs approach exploring things like extended warranties?<br></h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/612684b263c0a2d097bc3b25_Pam%20Schneider.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Prior to Clyde, Pam Schneider served in a series of executive positions for The Warranty Group, which was one of the world’s leading providers of warranty solutions and related insurance products, with operations in over 35 countries and more than $5 Billion in assets before it was acquired by Assurant.</figcaption></figure><p>Pam Schneider:&nbsp;They often are running hard and fast day to day trying to get stuff done. It can be hard for them to come up out of the fray to say, ‘Okay, I need X service or Y capability, and who can I go to to get it?’ Doing the diligence and research and filtering can feel like it’s going to take a lot more time than just doing it themselves.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But it’s not common to see a small- or medium-sized business have success with an in-house warranty program. Many honestly don’t even know about the option to have an extended warranty program to complement their manufacturer warranty or limited warranty, which is the warranty they’re required to have.&nbsp;</p><h3>As a primer, how would you explain extended warranties to a business owner who is new to them?<br></h3><p>An extended warranty program is a way of providing real value. They can give end consumers peace of mind about purchases that are vital to our work and lives. Clyde’s extended warranty model is made up of three parts:<br></p><ul><li>An <strong>obligor</strong>, or the entity that takes on the risk. If something breaks or needs repair, they’re ultimately responsible for that. In many cases, they’re backed by an insurance company, but they themselves are not necessarily an insurance company. Asurion, for instance, is one of Clyde’s obligors.</li><li>An <strong>administrator</strong> provides claims administration services; in other words, the service arm of the business. In some cases, Clyde is its own administrator and in other cases it leverages a partner’s expertise.</li><li>The <strong>merchant</strong>, who makes the offer to the end consumers. That can be from a regional electronics store to a nationwide conglomerate.</li></ul><h3>What are some of the risks that come with offering a warranty program?<br></h3><p>If you do it in-house, you’re responsible for pricing the product, making the offer, and setting aside funds to pay out claims.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If a product breaks and needs repair, those incidents incur a cost. And if you don't price your warranties appropriately to cover for what's known as the <strong>frequency</strong>, or the number of claims you get, and the <strong>severity</strong>, or how much it costs you to resolve that claim, it could put you out of business.<br></p><p>For a small or medium business to do an in-house program without having the expertise, they're kind of betting the farm. In many cases, if not most cases, they’re unknowingly&nbsp;taking a risk that could put them out of business.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The other risks come with the fact that these are regulated products, and how they are marketed and sold is subject to state-by-state regulations. Even an unfounded complaint can absorb a lot of time and energy, with the organization having to respond to a regulatory authority that is investigating a claim from an unhappy customer. It can really take up a lot of resources from an organization. And if the investigation deems that a customer was misled, there can be fines and other repercussions.&nbsp;</p><h3>How does using an extended warranty partner like Clyde address those risks?<br></h3><p>The risk of mispricing is all absorbed by Clyde and its partners, and we work with best-in-class providers in this space that have really robust compliance departments that review all marketing materials and how offers are being made to make sure that they conform with all regulatory provisions.<br></p><p>Our partners also have extensive history on how to price these products. So the margin of error is way smaller, and if they get it wrong, the risk of that is absorbed between Clyde and its partners.</p><h3>What value can extended warranty programs bring to SMBs? Can they find success despite not being a big-box retailer?&nbsp;<br></h3><p>Definitely. The value comes across multiple fronts: it can increase revenue, it can increase loyalty of their customers, it can provide an increased sense of quality and protection that they’re willing to stand by their product and offer this additional coverage, and it can drive repeat purchases.<br></p><p>And these are benefits that have no kind of hard cost outlay at the outset. We typically do not charge any kind of implementation fee or integration fee. They’re plug and play, so SMBs can launch a program in very little time, and there's no cost to them. There’s a bit of time invested, but it’s really minor, and anything they sell goes straight to the top line—and their bottom line.</p><h3>What’s the experience like for a merchant or end consumer using Clyde’s purchase protection plan?<br></h3><p>For merchants, when they sign up, they get an implementation consultant along with an account manager, who shepherds them through the process. It’s a fairly turnkey solution, where we provide them with all pre-approved, compliant material via an API that works directly with their platform. I've seen small and medium businesses launch in as quick as two days. It’s just a matter of getting their product catalogue and matching it to the right program.<br></p><p>They can change the sale price to the consumer via a merchant dashboard, where they can see what works best for their consumers from a pricing perspective.<br></p><p>For consumers, they’ll be offered product protection on the product page and in the shopping cart. If they purchase it, they’ll get an email with simple terms and conditions, as well as a link to Hi Clyde, our consumer portal, where they can register and, if their product breaks, submit a claim. Most merchants are hands-off in the claim process, but some want to be kept in the loop. During the claim, Clyde will track the repair or replacement and make sure it’s done in a satisfactory manner.</p><h3>How is the Clyde experience different from other extended warranty providers?<br></h3><p>It’s digital-first. It’s focused on creating a differentiated experience for eCommerce consumers. I previously worked at a warranty company that had old technology that’s hard to transform for the digital world. Clyde is designed for modern business, in a way that creates a lot more flexibility from a technology perspective. It makes it easier to integrate with the shopping platforms. And we own all our IP—we opted to build, not buy or partner—which makes it easier and quicker for us to enhance it and modify it over time.&nbsp;</p><h3>What advice would you give a SMB who is thinking about offering a product protection or extended warranty program?<br></h3><p>I would say you definitely don't want to go it alone, and that it's not a big lift. It's a really simple and easy way to offer an additional service to your customers.<br></p><p>There are providers like Clyde out there that are designed to work with small and medium businesses. It's not a big hill to climb; we can get them up and running in very little time, and they can start providing an additional value to their consumers, with virtually no investment on their part.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And don’t worry! The spam calls you get about auto extended warranties are not reflective of the industry. Our products do provide real value.</p><h3>Ready to learn more about extended warranties?</h3><p>Still have questions on how implementing a warranty program can help your SMB drive revenue and customer loyalty? <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Reach out and let’s get started</a>.</p>	Wed Aug 25 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
Everything You Need To Know About Buy Now Pay Later	everything-you-need-to-know-about-buy-now-pay-later	Everything You Need To Know About Buy Now Pay Later	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61eb08333f329433b446023c_BNPL.png	<p>When I lived in Argentina, it took me a while to get used to the idea of pagando en cuotas, or paying in monthly installments. You could pay for a couch, a TV, a pair of shoes, or even a steak dinner over <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/produccion/ahora12">3, 6, 12, or 24 installments</a>. It was a common option in a country whose inflation rate hit 54% in 2019, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-inflation/argentina-2019-inflation-was-53-8-highest-in-28-years-idUSKBN1ZE2P0">28-year-high</a>.<br></p><p>(And we’re here in the States complaining about a 7% rate of inflation! Though admittedly, it is the highest we’ve seen in this country in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-consumer-price-index-december-2021-11641940760">39 years</a>.)<br></p><p>But I soon recognized that Argentine cuotas were a staple of the economy. They were a way to help everyday people access cheap credit, better manage their cash flow, and spread out the risk of hyperinflation. At the same time, they allowed vendors to secure a sale and stay competitive.<br></p><p>It’s not just Argentina. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) financing is already a huge industry in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/buy-now-pay-later-11-3-trillion-opportunity-in-china-u-s-just-beginning/">Australia, the U.K., and China</a>. And in recent years, BNPL options have grown in popularity in the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/06/4-buy-now-pay-later-trends-smart-investors-are-wat/">2022 study</a> found that 6% of all online spending was financed by BNPL platforms in 2021. That number is expected to grow to 13% by 2025.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Buy now, pay later, also called lending at point of sale, is here to stay. Here, we’ll explore where it came from, how it works, and what it allows merchants—and consumers—to do.&nbsp;</p><h2>Buy Now Pay Later: Who’s it for?</h2><p>Previously, financing was reserved for big-ticket items. A car was bought with the help of a car loan. A house with the help of a mortgage. The seller and the buyer got what they needed, and the bank that provided the financing got a cut, too.<br></p><p>BNPL works a little differently.</p><h3>What is BNPL?</h3><p>It’s short-term financing. Consumers can use these installment loans to pay off purchases in weekly, biweekly, or monthly installments. Payments are often interest free for a set period of time—like three months—before high interest rates kick in. Just like a credit card, retailers pay a fee when consumers pay via BNPL options.&nbsp;</p><h3>Buy Now Pay Later for Businesses</h3><p>Retailers are in the business of finding buyers for their products and then convincing those buyers to make a purchase. Offering flexible payment options that align with consumer preferences helps with both parts of the equation. Per <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/buy-now-pay-later-five-business-models-to-compete">McKinsey</a>, 60% of consumers are likely to use BNPL / point-of-sale (POS) financing over the next 6-12 months.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But businesses thinking about offering BNPL options have to consider both the pros and the cons.</p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Boost to conversion rates. If your conversion rates are plummeting, it could be because customers get sticker shock at check-out, or because they see they aren’t able to pay their preferred way. Offering BNPL options can help convince customers to pull the trigger on a purchase, increasing conversion rates by 200-300%, says <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/us-lending-at-point-of-sale-the-next-frontier-of-growth">McKinsey</a>.</li><li>Increase in AOV. A study by BNPL option Affirm found that average order values were <a href="https://clear.co/blog/news/affirm-bnpl-in-ecommerce/">85% higher</a> when customers used their financing options.&nbsp;</li><li>Happier customers. We know that <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-product-protection-increases-customer-ltv-and-drives-loyalty">offering purchase protection can boost customer loyalty and satisfaction</a>. Offering flexible payment options can, too. 87% of consumers between 22 and 44 want to be able to break large purchases into monthly installments, per <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2020/workwear-affordable-essential-workers-frontline-bnpl/">pymts.com</a>.</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Additional costs. Banks, credit providers, and other lenders charge retailers a fee every time a customer uses their BNPL services. Per a 2021 report from the <a href="https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/payments-system-research-briefings/the-appeal-and-proliferation-of-buy-now-pay-later-consumer-and-merchant-perspectives/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20a%20BNPL,from%201%20to%203%20percent.">Federal Reserve</a>, BNPL merchant costs range from 1.5-7%, whereas debit or credit card transactions usually cost between 1-3%. Looking at the fine print will help retailers decide if it’s worth it.</li><li>Integration issues. Offering a new option at checkout could disrupt your current checkout flow. Retailers considering BNPL partners will need to consider how quickly and easily they can integrate the option onto their site.&nbsp;</li><li>Brand risk. More on this later, but some consumers see BNPL options as predatory. An <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-08-11/sleek-new-credit-apps-target-a-young-generation-already-drowning-in-debt"><em>LA Times</em> headline</a> sums it up: “Sleek, new credit apps target a young generation already drowning in debt.” An <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/edge-integrating-buy-now-pay-later-predatory-and-disappointing">op-ed on Windows’ Edge</a> browser and its BNPL integration is similarly titled “Microsoft Edge integrating buy now, pay later is predatory and disappointing.” Brands may not want to associate with the practice.</li></ul><h3>Buy Now Pay Later for the Customer</h3><p>The fast-climbing numbers of American consumers using BNPL options proves that they’re popular. Interestingly enough, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/buy-now-pay-later-five-business-models-to-compete">McKinsey’s research</a> found that “while the average credit score of consumers using these solutions is under 700, this has less to do with bad credit history and more to do with relatively thin credit files.”<br></p><p>That means that BNPL is becoming a helpful option for buyers making purchases online, which is at least <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA">13% of all sales</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But customers considering BNPL options should be familiar with both the pros and the cons.</p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Free credit. This is the main benefit of BNPL for consumers. If buyers take advantage of BNPL providers’ interest-free periods, they can get free credit without having to wait to receive their purchase (like a typical layaway option). That credit can help them manage their cashflow or expand their investment options. For example, someone buying a $600 TV via three $200 monthly payments could spread that big purchase out, making sure they had enough to cover utilities. Or, after making their first payment, they could invest the remaining $200 payments and get a return on them for 29 and 59 extra days before having to pay it.</li><li>No hard credit check. BNPL options are easier to qualify for than a credit card, per the <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/credit-cards/how-does-buy-now-pay-later-work/">Motley Fool</a>, and providers don’t run a hard credit check before approving you, which helps with your credit score.</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>High interest rates and late fees. There’s always a catch. BNPL’s free credit jumps to very expensive credit if a buyer misses a payment. APR can go as high as 30%, sometimes applicable from the initial date of the loan, and late fees range from $0 to $10, per <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/personal-loans/buy-now-pay-later#:~:text=While%20Pay%20in%204%20doesn,25%25%20of%20the%20order%20value.">Nerdwallet</a>.</li><li>Risk of overspending. If BNPL options mean higher AOV for retailers, that means higher spend by consumers—not all of whom might be ready to make it. A <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/personal/buy-now-pay-later-survey/">LendingTree survey</a> of more than 1,000 American consumers found that 67% of people who had used BNPL services said that those services caused them to spend more money than they otherwise would’ve. Nearly half said they wouldn’t have made the purchase without the option to finance.&nbsp;</li><li>Less protection. Purchases made with a credit card are protected by consumer credit laws. For example, if a buyer never got a computer they ordered, they could call their credit card company and get help immediately, with a resolution within two billing cycles. BNPL lenders <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/shopping-retail/hidden-risks-of-buy-now-pay-later-plans-a7495893275/">aren’t held accountable</a> to regulatory laws in the same way. (Yet.)</li></ul><h2>Popular Buy Now Pay Later Services and Apps + How They Work</h2><p>Considering the popularity of their product, BNPL service providers are only going to continue to grow. Here are some of the most popular types of providers in 2022:</p><h3>Afterpay and Klarna</h3><p>Both <a href="https://www.afterpay.com/">Afterpay</a> and <a href="https://www.klarna.com/us/">Klarna</a> work as “Pay in 4” models, which means they finance small-ticket purchases, usually less than $250, via 4 biweekly installments. Popular vertices include apparel and footwear, fitness, accessories, and beauty, per <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/buy-now-pay-later-five-business-models-to-compete">McKinsey</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Both offer 0% APR, 4 installments due every 2 weeks, and late fees of $7-8.<br></p><p><a href="https://zip.co/us">Zip</a> and <a href="https://sezzle.com/">Sezzle</a> work similarly.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Afterpay and Klarna both charge retailers 4-6% and $0.30 per transaction.</p><h3>Affirm</h3><p><a href="https://www.affirm.com/">Affirm</a> is an off-card financing solution. Like other similar solutions, it’s most popular in verticals like electronics, furniture and home goods, sports equipment, and travel, per <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/buy-now-pay-later-five-business-models-to-compete">McKinsey</a>. Average purchase size is $800, with loans lasting 8-9 months on average.<br></p><p>It works by charging consumers an APR, which is sometimes subsidized by the merchant, that is often lower than a credit card.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Payment schedules vary, but are between 6-12 months, with a 15-30% APR, based on consumer credit. Affirm charges no late fees.<br></p><p>For merchants, Affirm <a href="https://www.affirm.com/business/faq">charges</a> 5.99% and $0.30 per transaction.&nbsp;</p><h3>Splitit</h3><p><a href="https://www.splitit.com/">Splitit</a> is a fintech company that helps buyers use existing credit or debit cards to make purchases. Their system puts a hold on the credit card and charges the card every month until the payment is completed. It uses the credit the buyer already has, without giving buyers an additional loan (and thus without asking for an additional application or credit check).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Per <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/buy-now-pay-later-five-business-models-to-compete">McKinsey</a>, card-linked installment plans like Splitit help with purchases of an overage $1,000, and are more popular with higher earners.<br></p><p>Splitit charges no interest or late fees to buyers and offers terms of 6 to 24 months.<br></p><p>For merchants, Splitit’s <a href="https://www.splitit.com/business/up-to-2m/">fees</a> start at 1.5% and $1.50 per installment.</p><h2>Is Buy Now Pay Later Right for Your Business? 4 Questions</h2><p>As a business owner, you know that there are, at any given point, dozens of things you could be doing to help improve your bottom line and please your customers.<br></p><p>How do you know if investing in setting up a BNPL option is the right thing to focus on?<br></p><p>Ask yourself these 4 questions to get started.</p><h3>What Are My Margins?</h3><p>Your margin is the price of your product minus the expense of getting that product sold. Can you afford to spend another $1.50 or $0.30, per the per-transaction charges listed above, to sell your product?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Those numbers aren’t huge. And it’s not like you’d be losing half of your margin on a $5 t-shirt; BNPL tends to be used for purchases of $100 and up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But you do have limited margins to cut into, and you need to think about the opportunity cost. Could that money provide more value offered to the customer as a straight-up discount? Or invested in additional marketing?&nbsp;</p><h3>How Do Transaction Costs Compare?</h3><p>You’re used to paying fees for each credit card transaction. Are the fees of the BNPL platform you’re considering comparable?&nbsp;<br></p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/credit-card-processing-fees#:~:text=Credit%20card%20processing%20fees%20will,how%20to%20lower%20your%20rates.">Nerdwallet</a>, credit card processing fees cost businesses 1.5-3% of the transaction’s total. Klarna’s fee, starting at 4%, is only slightly above that. But if you go with Affirm, you might pay double that, at 5.99%.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Make sure you understand what costs you’d be facing based on your industry and average purchase order.</p><h3>Does The Practice of “Buying Now and Paying Later” Fit My Brand Identity and Values?</h3><p>It’s not just the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-08-11/sleek-new-credit-apps-target-a-young-generation-already-drowning-in-debt"><em>LA Times</em></a>. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2021/08/17/the-dangerous-rise-of-buy-now-pay-later-offers/?sh=7c28b1852d14">Forbes columnists</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/qc60nc/thoughts_around_buy_now_pay_later_culture/">Reddit posters</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hidden-dangers-buy-now-pay-later-apps/"><em>Wired</em> reporters</a> are all talking about the problematic nature of BNPL apps that may push consumers into buying more than they can afford.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The issue isn’t black and white. As explored above, BNPL platforms come with plenty of pros, and they can be hugely beneficial to savvy consumers who understand the fine print and steer clear of late payments.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But since consumers <em>can</em> be caught unawares, and end up in debt, there is definitely an ethical component to consider. Is offering an BNPL option right for you, your brand, and your typical buyer?<br></p><p>As an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/01/jeans-now-pay-later/617257/"><em>Atlantic </em>columnist reported</a>, “‘That line between helpful and predatory can be really blurry…what may be predatory to one type of customer is actually a very good solution for another type of customer.’”</p><h3>What’s the Risk of Potential Future Regulations?</h3><p>No BNPL company on the market today is profitable, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddb2e207-2450-4ca8-bad0-871290d80ea7">reports the <em>Financial TImes</em></a>, and that’s largely because the sector isn’t very regulated. New players are entering and trying to grab a piece of the pie, jacking up acquisition costs for competitors.<br></p><p>But BNPL platforms and businesses alike have to stay wary, because regulations are coming. The next “credit event” will result in “material amplification of pressure from government and regulators,” per the <em>FT</em>. Profit margins will be cut, which means higher prices for retailers, on top of the risk of bad press.&nbsp;</p><h2>Alternative Differentiators to Offer Instead of Buy Now, Pay Later Financing</h2><p>If point-of-sale financing isn’t right for your brand or business, but you still want to invest in improving your AOV and your customer satisfaction, try one of these tactics:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Implementing other </strong><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-ecommerce-technology-works-together"><strong>microservices</strong></a>, like a better search tool, product protection options, or an easier checkout, that can improve conversion rates and customer experience without having to build brand-new tools (here are <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/5-e-commerce-technologies-to-implement-today">4 great ecomm plug-ins </a>aside from BNPL)</li><li><strong>Offering free shipping, which is consumers’ </strong><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/what-shoppers-look-for-when-buying-online"><strong>number-one favorite benefit</strong></a></li><li><strong>Invest in excellent customer service, which can create </strong><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/7-ways-to-differentiate-your-business-from-the-competition"><strong>genuine brand advocates</strong></a></li></ul><h2>Optimize Your Checkout Experience with Clyde&nbsp;</h2><p>Customers who choose BNPL options do so for two reasons: it derisks the purchase and it helps them stretch their money.<br></p><p>Offering product protection does both of those things, too.<br></p><p>Clyde’s extended warranty program gives consumers extra peace of mind by protecting their purchases in the case of product failure or accident.

Expos and Trade Shows Are Back—But Different	expos-and-trade-shows-are-back-but-different	Expos and Trade Shows Are Back—But Different	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6128ec26ab21b55880c5022a_Expos%20and%20Conferences%20Artwork%203.png	<p>“Trade shows are terribly expensive and of limited value for the business you do versus the dollars spent.”<br></p><p>That’s what a senior vice president of an industrial company <a href="https://hbr.org/1983/01/get-more-out-of-your-trade-shows">told the <em>Harvard Business Review</em></a>.<br></p><p>In 1983.<br></p><p>People have been complaining about trade shows for nearly 40 years. And with good reason: they went away entirely in 2020, yet <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf">eCommerce had its best year yet</a>. How can you justify spending big bucks, shelling out for space with the hope of having it pay off in terms of brand awareness or sales, when you could otherwise spend that money, like so many eComm brands did in 2020, on digital marketing efforts for a more easily measurable boost?<br></p><p>You justify it like this: there’s nothing like being in-person.<br></p><p>Companies know that. It’s why even all-remote teams gather together once or twice a year for offsite and retreats. Families know that; it’s why they host reunions.<br></p><p>And eComm companies know that, too, which is why they’re signing up for trade shows again—though carefully, considering the looming threat of the delta variant, and judiciously, considering what they learned about marketing ROI during the lockdown.<br></p><p>Though trade shows do seem to be back, they won’t look the same. We looked at research reports and talked to industry experts for this explainer on the future of in-person marketing events. It’s part of our series <strong>Growth Reimagined: eComm Strategies That Work, No Lease Required</strong>, all of which look at successful marketing strategies and share expert perspective on what their future holds:<br></p><ol><li><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman">The Art of the Pop-Up, Redux</a></li><li><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-future-of-influencer-marketing-is-here-6-trends-from-territorys-rafael-schwarz">The Future of Influencer Marketing Is Here</a></li><li><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-future-of-influencer-marketing-is-here-6-trends-from-territorys-rafael-schwarz">Meet You at the (Virtual) Mall: An Intro to Social Shopping</a></li><li><strong>Expos and Trade Shows Are Back—But Different</strong><br></li></ol><p>We looked at how pop-ups offer eComm companies flexible ways to explore retail and brand-building, how influencer partnerships can cost millions—or absolutely nothing, and how social shopping brings together the physical experience of window shopping with the tech-enabled ease of eComm. And now we’re finishing off the series by exploring the <a href="https://hbr.org/1983/01/get-more-out-of-your-trade-shows"><em>HBR</em>’s</a> favorite topic: trade shows.<br></p><h2>What happened to trade shows in 2020?<br></h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danica-tormohlen-5800621/">Danica Tormohlen</a> is a journalist who has covered trade shows for more than 20 decades. She’s penned thousands of words about the industry, but has just one to describe what 2020 was like: “Devastating.”<br></p><p>“Many trade shows were forced to postpone or cancel due to gathering restrictions and capacity limits caused by the pandemic. Only a handful of trade shows serving the retail sector, such as Surf Expo, MAGIC, WWIN, OFFPRICE, Las Vegas Market, Atlanta Gift &amp; Apparel Market, have been held since March 2020,” explains Danica.<br></p><p>A <a href="https://www.reportlinker.com/p05893058/Exhibitions-Events-Market-Global-Outlook-and-Forecast.html">report published in May 2020</a> looked at the future growth of trade shows and anticipated single-digit expansion through 2025, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. (The entrance fees alone hit $30 billion in 2019!) 2020 slowed that growth significantly as the global exhibition and trade show industry shrunk by 68%, resulting in the loss of 2.4 million jobs, per <a href="https://tradeshowexecutive.com/ufi-reports-staggering-industry-losses-in-2020/">February 2021 reporting</a>.<br></p><p>Jason Bradwell, host of <a href="https://b2bbite.substack.com/">B2B Better and author of B2B Bite</a>, a podcast and a newsletter aimed at helping early stage b2b marketing teams do better than boring work, explains it from the businesses’ perspective: 2020 took the position of power away from the trade shows.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Historically, trade shows have really been the backbone of any kind of marketing strategy, particularly when you're working with incredibly long sales cycles that range from three months to three years,” he says. “In-person moments where you can connect and reconnect with potential customers and existing customers in person has been super important. Trade shows were in a position of power, where they have been able to charge incredibly high fees for booth space, speaking opportunities, networking events. That’s no longer true.”<br></p><h2>What has 2021 looked like for the trade show industry?<br></h2><p>Trade shows got through 2020—and started off 2021—by going virtual. As Danica wrote for <a href="https://www.pcma.org/challenge-virtual-trade-shows-exhibit-halls/">PCMA</a>:<br></p><p><em>There’s no such thing as a virtual exhibition, said Jochen Witt during a Web Summit 2020 panel discussion in December. “It’s nonsense. It does not exist. An exhibition is feel, taste, smell, touch. It’s not possible virtually, it’s not possible digitally. Did you ever take a digital swim or a virtual meal?”</em><br></p><p>That being said, virtual trade shows and expos happened; CES, the largest annual trade show in the States, was one of the shows that went entirely online. It still allowed attendees to explore new products and offerings, and Danica tells Clyde that she expects to see hybrid expos continue in 2021, as organizers offer in-person events for smaller groups but host virtual gatherings for those who can’t (or don’t feel safe) joining.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Events that do happen in-person are continuing to evolve their policies based on the latest COVID news, some requiring masks, proof of vaccination, or both. Organizers are also likely to keep more flexible registration policies, where attendees who change their plans last-minute can put some or all of their registration fee towards future attendance.<br></p><p>CES is keeping a digital component for 2022; they’ve already announced that while they’ll have an in-person show January 5-8 in Las Vegas, they’ll include virtual events as well. Other big trade shows are prioritizing an in-person return: Pack Expo will be in Las Vegas in September, InfoComm is live from Orlando in October, and HX: The Hotel Experience is heading to New York in November.<br></p><p>While many shows are planning to come back in 2021, they may find that attendance has dropped.<br></p><p>A <a href="https://www2.globalspec.com/2021_report_industrialmarketingin2021_views">GlobalSpec survey</a> of industrial marketers found that 29% of them didn’t budget for tradeshows at all in 2021, whereas 38% are planning to spend some money, but less than they did in previous years. (That may be just because business travel was an impossibility for many people for at least the first half of the year, though.)<br></p><p>Jason falls into that 38%—for now. “Will l I revert to simply paying a five-figure, six-figure sum for a trade booth at a conference that, at least for the next 12 to 18 months, is going to be somewhat localized?” asks the UK-based marketer.<br></p><h2>What opportunities exist for trade shows?<br></h2><p>If 2020 wasn’t the death knell for trade shows, 2021 certainly won’t be. Jason is excited about two types of innovative events that came out of the industry’s tough last year, and hopes to see the industry lean more into them:<br></p><ul><li>Small-scale networking events. Trade shows have been effective in the past because of their networking potential, says Jason, and smart conferences and expos have found a way to replicate that. Instead of dumping hundreds of people in a Zoom, though, successful virtual events have offered up free, interesting experiences—from webinars to conferences to networking events—that connect big-dollar sponsors directly with their target buyers.</li><li>Talent incubators. “I’ve seen [events] bring together some of the best-of-breed new kids on the block that are standing to transform a particular industry, bundling them together into some kind of incubator and giving sponsors an opportunity to engage or invest in those startups,” says Jason. “They then build a kind of content or digital program around that experience.”<br></li></ul><h2>What opportunities exist for eComm companies?&nbsp;<br></h2><p>What does the average marketing director do with this changing landscape? One, sign up for trade shows that still make sense given their industry (As Clyde just did at RetailX). Here are specific cases Danica would have you think about:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Companies who usually face stiff competition. </strong>“There will likely be less competition from international companies who may not be able to get into the U.S. and even some national brands who might have corporate travel bans in place, at least in the short term,” explains Danica.</li><li><strong>Companies with available product.</strong> “As <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-clyde-ecommerce-conversation-august-18th">supply chains issues and shipping delays persist</a>, many retailers who I have interviewed in recent months report they are looking at attending trade shows to find new vendors who have product ready for delivery<strong>,”</strong> says Danica<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Companies who haven’t exhibited before. </strong>If you’re new to exhibiting, you just might be able to get in at a sweet deal. Danica has some advice: “Ask organizers if they offer first-time discounts, a product showcase or any other promotional packages to help first-time exhibitors.”<br></li></ul><p>Additionally, remaining committed to investing in other marketing avenues, especially ones you can control more of, like social and content (hello from this content piece you’re reading!) is vital.<br></p><p>On that second point, Jason suggests asking one question: “How do we deliver more value and expertise to the world and shift that focus away from us going to customers and more to bringing the customers to us?”<br></p><p>If your company hasn’t invested in owned content before, Jason suggests starting by finding a competitor or two who are doing well in social, content, and community marketing. “Use that as your case studies to add credibility to your argument as to why this is worth exploring,” he says.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“It’s going to be a balancing act, in terms of how marketers leverage trade shows and conferences and external events and marry them up with their own events and their marketing strategies. It’s a build or buy argument: where do you choose to <strong>build</strong> your own audience, where do you choose to <strong>buy</strong> access to another audience?” asks Jason. “You will need both.”<br></p>	Fri Aug 27 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
What You Probably Didn't Know About Extended Warranties	extended-warranties-what-you-didnt-know	What You Probably Didn't Know About Extended Warranties	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb9159c0f5b5d7a8a38eb24_catrin-johnson-486188-unsplash.jpg	<h2>What You Probably Didn't Know About Extended Warranties</h2><p>Extended warranties, as we know them today, were first offered to car buyers in the 1960s. Competition from foreign car manufacturers necessitated that major domestic automakers offer comprehensive protection coverage on all “wear items” as well as the labor required to fix the vehicle. Over time these extended warranties began to cover virtually anything that could go wrong with a car within the first few years of purchase or 100,000 miles of use. </p><p>While most consumers are familiar with the evolution of warranties in the automotive space, few are aware of their impact on consumer goods in recent years. The vast studies conducted by automakers like Ford, GM and Chrysler found that not only were extended warranties necessary to remain competitive, but they also served as a key factor in turning first-time buyers into life-long customers. </p><p>Similarly, consumer brands have made a connection between extended warranties and their ability to sell multiple products and upgrades to the same consumer. &nbsp;Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart are some of the biggest sellers of extended warranties in the US today, while Apple’s “AppleCare” program has reimagined what a warranty program can do in terms of customer retention. </p><p>But it’s not just the global players that have found significant monetary and brand value in extended warranties. Merchants, of all sizes, have come to understand the intrinsic value of the extended warranty, taking them from the world of fine print to the forefront of their business.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e2bf70d87a69f1065770_5b3bd3eeb58c692b6c217191_broken-iphone-6.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2>What are extended warranties?</h2><p>Extended warranties are referred to by different titles depending on the industry, ranging from service contracts to maintenance agreements. What they all share is a common definition. Extended warranties are simply prolonged warranty offerings that merchants offer to consumers in addition to a standard product warranty. These extended warranty can be offered by the warranty administrator, the merchant or the manufacturer. These extended warranties serve as an insurance policy on your consumers purchases, safeguard it against expensive, unforeseen repairs.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e2bf16ec999e6bf020cb_5b2d6173d4bf817793096074_applecare.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>What do extended warranties cover?</strong></h2><p>What is covered under an extended warranties can vary from industry to industry and oftentimes requires a consumer to read the fine print of their contract. But, by and large, extended warranties often cover the following:&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Electrical or mechanical breakdown</h3><p>From a car down to a smart watch, extended warranties protect consumers when there is an incidence of electrical or mechanical malfunction within their purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Accidental Damage From Handling (ADH)</h3><p>Many extended warranties include protection from ADH. As an example, laptops that suffer damage from any accidents stemming from normal use are covered starting from the moment of purchase. Accidents like drops and spills during the term of the contract are covered, while operational or mechanical failure caused by theft, misplacement, negligence, viruses, or reckless behavior are not. </p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e2bf16ec999931f020cc_5b2d620b6bddb41831308560_pexels-photo-997718.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2>Who offers extended warranties?</h2><p>Extended warranties are offered virtually anywhere consumer products are sold. To give you an idea of the variety of industries that utilize extended warranties, here are just a few of the sectors that Clyde covers.&nbsp;<br></p><h4>Consumer electronics</h4><h4>Auto Parts</h4><h4>Jewelry</h4><h4>Appliances</h4><h4>Furniture</h4><h4>Outdoor Equipment</h4><h4>Mattresses</h4><h4>Bicylces</h4><h4>Musical Instruments</h4><h4>Drones</h4><h4>Sports Equipment</h4><p><br></p><h2>What types of products offer extended warranties?</h2><h4>Blenders</h4><h4>Televisions</h4><h4>Smartphones</h4><h4>Diamond rings</h4><h4>Stationary Bikes</h4><h4>Speciality mattresses</h4><h4>Drumkits&nbsp;</h4><h4>Rowing machines</h4><h4>Drones</h4><h4>Firepits</h4><h4>Couches</h4><h4>Auto Parts</h4><h2>How much do extended warranties cost?</h2><p>The cost and length of extended warranties varies significantly by sector and are often tethered to overall product cost. Automobile extended warranties generally range from $300 to $700 per year, while smartphone extended warranties fall in the $10 to $25 range while providing monthly opt outs.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Benefits of extended warranties <br></h2><h3>For Merchants</h3><p>In the eyes of consumers, warranties have become synonymous with high quality products. It’s akin to a merchant standing by their product from day one, while also providing a consumer with guaranteed peace of mind. Consumers have also begun to expect guarantees when purchasing items. If they feel secure that they’ll be satisfied with their purchase, they’re more likely to make that purchase in the first place.</p><h3>For Consumers&nbsp;</h3><p>Any purchase, large or small, comes with a bit of trepidation about the period of time one can enjoy the item. Product warranties provide consumers with peace of mind and a feeling of security.<br></p><h2>Best extended warranty examples<br></h2><h3>Smartphones</h3><p>Now that smartphones have shot past the $1,000 mark, insurancing purchases against electrical damage is both wise and economical. Services like Clyde have allowed merchants to create flexible and affordable plans that protect consumers in the event of unexpected damage. It is worth noting that while some plans may seem cheap on the surface, high deductibles have the potential to make the contract less economically appealing in the long run.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Appliances</h3><p>A manufacturer’s warranty or factory warranty often applies to appliances in the short term, but an extended warranty has the potential to cover nearly inevitable wear and tear issues. Blenders, toasters, and air fryers can all be covered in the event of mechanical or electrical failure, which is a wise investment for consumers who plan on using these kitchen appliances with regularity.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>Seven Things Merchants Should Consider when Evaluating an Extended Warranty Program<br></h2><h3>How much revenue can you expect<br></h3><p>The beauty of warranty programs is that with careful planning, you can determine within a finite window just how much revenue you can expect to collect from said program. To help you determine if it does, we’ve created a worksheet / calculator you can download that walks you through both the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101eunXCkW8Z9Co6exCdNgqprHHPPVB1Jd3KDP-GTSlA/edit?usp=sharing">direct and indirect revenue effects of implementing an Extended Warranty Program</a> in your business.<br></p><h3>Brand Impact<br></h3><p>In recent years, the negative stigma surrounding warranties has lifted, but it is worth monitoring and aligning your messaging to reflect the positive impact warranties deliver to consumers. Research has proven that extended warranty offerings with CTA language centered around&nbsp; “product protection” have performed better than those that directly&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Ease of Use<br></h3><p>Consumers have historically disliked warranties because they’re not sure how to access their benefits when the time comes. Utilizing an ease-to-use platform like Clyde’s can actually delight your customers and make them feel like their investment in the warranty and by extension your brand was a wise one.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Legal Compliance<br></h3><p>Both the federal government and states have weighed in on what should be covered in terms of factory or manufacturer warranties, but there’s also compliance issues within the extended warranty space. Consulting a lawyer and insurance provided is vital before offering a program to consumers.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Flexibility<br></h3><p>While long-term contracts are more profitable, offering warranties that have shorter time horizons or opts out is a delight balancing act, because consumers love to have options available to them.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>An Experienced Insurer<br></h3><p>Make sure that whatever solution providers you’re evaluating have experience and previous examples of covering your specific type of products. Certain insurance providers specialize more in some areas than others - such as furniture, jewelry, or consumer electronics. Although most insurers will provide custom underwriting if the opportunity (your revenue) is large enough, you should still evaluate their network of service centers, as well as any other retailers they are currently servicing in that category.<br></p><h3>Competitive Pricing<br></h3><p>Last, but certainly not least, is price. Make sure the prices offered for extended warranties are competitive. If you’re unable to apply 25-50% of a markup on the prices you receive and stay price-competitive, your costs are most likely too high. Keep in mind that the most significant revenue effect of selling an extended warranty is securing the customer’s second sale should the product fail (which is 20% of the time).<br><br></p><h2>Extended warranty management software</h2><p>Clyde leverages multiple partnerships to bring a robust catalog of coverage options, facilitating extended warranty at the date of purchase, warranty extension plans, accidental damage coverage at the date of purchase, and limited warranty and limited warranty extension programs. Our platform was designed to provide a simple and transparent insurance experience for your business, your team, and your end-customers.<br><br></p>	Tue Aug 21 2018 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jacob-stein

First 100 Days: What A Biden Presidency Means For Retailers	first-100-days-what-a-biden-presidency-means-for-retailers	First 100 Days: What a Biden Presidency Means for Retailers	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/600b368a98512487ee7b7b98_Biden%E2%80%99s%20First%20100%20Days%20in%20Office%20-%20Option%204.png	<p>A new president and a new administration bring with them fresh focus and urgency, especially for the first 100 days.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We have <a href="https://www.history.com/news/fast-facts-on-the-first-100-days">President Franklin D. Roosevelt to thank for that</a>, who took office in 1933.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Coming onboard amidst a devastating financial crisis, he hit the ground running with his New Deal, rolling out 15 substantive pieces of legislation in his first 100 days. Before that, no president’s efficacy was measured by what happened in their first ~3 months. Today, those first 100 days are critical to the public perception of a president. <br></p><p>Enter President Joe Biden. Perhaps no president since FDR has inherited such a wide collection of crises as the 46th president. While President Obama had an economic crisis on his hands in 2008, Biden will have one of those along with an ongoing and increasingly deadly pandemic, social strife, and national security concerns in the wake of the riots at the U.S. Capitol.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here, we explore what the first 100 days of a Biden presidency might mean for retailers, including:<br></p><ul><li>What his <strong>economic stimulus plan</strong> will mean for small businesses.</li><li>How his pandemic response will impact consumer spending.</li><li>Where we’re likely to see new investment in line with his “build back better” approach.<br></li></ul><h3><strong>Immediate economic relief: What Biden is planning for working families &amp; businesses</strong><br></h3><p>2021 has, so far, been full of the same suffering so many Americans became acquainted with in 2020: sustained low wages, high unemployment, and high costs of living that mean that many families are barely holding on. The same goes for businesses.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Once the Paycheck Protection Program’s funds were wiped out, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/12/01/ppp-sba-data/">largely by large corporations with political pull instead of the small businesses they were intended to help</a>, small businesses were left out to dry, forced to cut staff, sell off assets, and deal with depressed demand on their own.<br></p><p><a href="https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/">Biden’s plans</a> to relieve some of that pressure on individuals and businesses include:</p><ul><li>$1400 checks&nbsp;</li><li>Rent and food assistance, with $30 billion going to low-income households struggling with rent and utility bills&nbsp;</li><li>More inclusive healthcare, with expansions to Obamacare (currently tagged as “Bidencare”; you’d think we could’ve gotten some new branding)&nbsp;</li><li>Expanded unemployment benefits, including a $400 federal unemployment supplement that would begin when the current $300/week supplement expires in March 2021; it would go until at least September 2021&nbsp;</li><li>Student loan debt reform, including forgiveness for up to $10,000 per borrower&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>All this means that businesses who were operating as leanly as possible might have a real chance to invest in their employees and products again, increasing hiring and spending more on training, R&amp;D, and manufacturing—and that families will have a chance to catch up on debt and invest in housing and education.<br></p><h3><strong>Ramping up to slow down: how Biden’s pandemic response will play out</strong><br></h3><p>Biden’s plan to address the deadly coronavirus pandemic is decidedly different from President Trump’s in that it<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/biden-proposed-science-led-new-deal-end-pandemic-suffering"> includes perspectives from scientists and public health experts</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://joebiden.com/covid19/">That plan</a>, which hopes to get cases under control ASAP and schools open by March, includes:<br></p><ul><li>A national mask mandate</li><li>Expanded testing, including doubling the number of drive-through testing sites, and investing in at-home tests</li><li>Investing in a national vaccination program, including building new community vaccination centers</li><li>Hiring 100,000 new community health workers to help with the vaccination rollout and contact tracing</li><li>Using the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of PPE&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>For retailers, this likely means that after a <strong><em>short period of increased restrictions and lockdowns</em></strong>, they’ll be able to return to some version of business as usual in 2021. For businesses in the PPE, testing, or medical industries, it represents a new opportunity for government contracts and sustained sales, and for retailers in the grocery and home goods space who have already seen pandemic spikes, it means a potential return to normal sales.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>“Build back better”: inclusive investment in areas like clean energy, affordable housing, healthcare, caregiving, and education&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>Biden’s plan for the American economy—and beyond that, for the American people—is focused on his mantra to “<a href="https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/">build back better</a>.” It’s alliterative and it’s also aspirational; instead of catching up to the pace of the pre-pandemic economy, his plan is to create a fairer economy that treats its workers better all the time, not just when those workers are the only thing keeping a critical supply chain running. The<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/janet-yellen-new-treasury-secretary/"> nomination of Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary</a> implies that more spending will be the rule of the day.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That includes:<br></p><ul><li>Overall improvements to working conditions, like raising the minimum wage to $15 and providing paid sick leave for all workers</li><li>Investing in <a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/">zero-emission public transit options</a> for every American city with 100,000 or more residents (think light rail, bus lines, and bicycle infrastructure)</li><li>Upgrading 4 million buildings to be in line with energy efficiency standards</li><li>Building 1.5 million sustainable homes and housing units</li><li>Supporting 1 million auto industry jobs to win the electric vehicle race</li><li>Adding a $5,000 tax credit for informal caregivers like stay-at-home parents and those who take care of aging family members</li><li>$450 billion investment in elder care</li><li>Training 35,000 workers to support substance abuse counseling and care</li><li>Providing free <a href="https://joebiden.com/caregiving/">childcare</a> for 3- and 4-year olds&nbsp;</li><li>Creating an $8,000 tax credit for families to help pay for child care&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>This means not only that the economy will be a more just one, with fewer wage gaps across gender and racial lines, but also a more innovative one—federal investment in new areas is a great opportunity for innovators in energy, healthcare, education, and other industries to develop new products and solutions to lead not just the U.S. but the world into this new decade.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Looking to the next 100 days—and beyond</strong><br></h3><p>Biden’s presidency, and certainly his first 100 days, is set up to follow the general arc of many a Democratic president before him: increased spending, generous stimulus programs, and policies intended to help both businesses and individual Americans find success.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The difference this time is that he’ll be doing it in a (say it with us now) <strong><em>unprecedented</em></strong> environment of crises in public health, race relations, and markets. His aggressive plans could mean that long-suffering businesses, particularly smaller ones, could finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. First will come the glow of one-time stimulus to get them through a stricter period of lockdown; then, the sustaining brightness of consumers with more money in their pockets and a more optimistic look at the future, ready to spend.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But there’s no such thing as a free lunch. If Biden does manage to guide the economy to a full recovery, we’re likely to see a Biden tax plan that increases the tax rate for Americans earning more than 400k (from 37% to 39.6%), for corporations (from 21% to 28%), and a new minimum tax on corporations that earn $100 million or more in on-book income. </p><p>‍</p><p>*We'll be periodically updating this article as new fiscal programs and initiatives are implemented in the coming months. </p><p><br></p>	Fri Jan 22 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
Grinding To The Top: One-On-One With Thomas Fields	grinding-to-the-top-one-on-one-with-thomas-fields	Grinding To The Top: One-On-One With Thomas Fields	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60379c4d44ef7cd2ed93e6c8_GRIND-BlackHistoryMonth-Collage-LtBlue.jpg	<p>It’s said that the best entrepreneurs solve critical problems for their customers. For Thomas Fields, his business journey began by solving one of his own problems.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In 2011, Fields was on the mend from his second ACL tear. This relegated him to working on his shooting accuracy. In practice, this is often a solo activity, but shooting drills are materially enhanced when a player has a rebounder with them. As he waited for a coach to arrive before school one cold winter morning, the wheels started turning in his head. By the time he was stood up by his coach, the idea that would become “GRIND” was starting to come together. “What if I didn’t need a coach to open the gym?” Fields thought. “What if I could bring my own machine?”<br></p><p>That simple question, as it turned out, was the first domino to fall. “I just started sketching a design for a shooting machine that I could’ve used right there at the time,” Fields said. “I got more and more into it until it became an obsession. I knew I had something.”<br></p><p>What developed over the coming years was a blueprint, a prototype and eventually a company. GRIND produces shooting machines that fold into a large duffel bag. In their words, it is the world's first truly portable basketball shooting machine. GRIND is also developing software for the machine so players can track their analytics and even challenge players from all over the world. At its core, GRIND serves as a personal training device, which allows players to stream personal trainers and refine their shooting techniques in real time.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9AZK68IfuM"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍<br>We sat down with Thomas to discuss his journey as an African American entrepreneur, the partnerships he’s made along the way and GRIND’s ambitious future.<br></p><h3>As a first-time business owner, what was it like getting GRIND off the ground and what were the hurdles you needed to overcome to make it a reality?&nbsp;<br></h3><p>It was really hard in the early-going. I started in the garage, as a self-taught mechanical engineer. My father introduced me to business thinking, but as a blue collar, hard-working guy, he didn’t have an engineering background that I could tap into, nor was there a lot of family money to rely upon. I grew up in a neighborhood that was predominantly filled with single-parent households and I saw that community, over time, become gentrified. And that sparked a mentality in me that I needed to move fast, and I needed to create things in order to take control of my future. I could only really do that by innovating and creating my own future.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So instead of focusing on some of the challenges, I figured I would play the hand I was dealt. I didn’t have a wealthy network that could offer me hundreds of thousands of dollars in seed money, and it wasn’t easy convincing people that a 20-year-old could launch a company selling hardware. So I went about self-funding the company by working part-time jobs, and didn’t dwell on some of the challenges that unfortunately are magnified for minority founders. And that hard work led to meeting tremendous individuals who would become advisors to GRIND and eventually investors in the company. Once that money was in the door and we got our prototype off the ground, we made some real revenue and that very quickly attracted more investors. It was a lot of legwork, but at the end of the day, I think it made me stronger as a person and as a leader.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>One of GRIND’s strengths is its branding, which does a tremendous job of connecting with the basketball community via social media. Why do you think people have connected with the company so quickly?<br></h3><p>I think a part of it is that GRIND is intentionally design-driven. We focus on what customers want, what problems they’re trying to solve and ultimately what they need to be better basketball players. The basketball community has really responded to that and they’ve been very welcoming to us because they see our clear vision at work.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The truth is, a lot of companies don’t necessarily care about kids if they don’t make it to the NBA. GRIND, on the other hand, deeply cares about kids throughout their journey, whether they make it to that college or pro level. I was a prime example of someone who came from similar neighborhoods and didn’t make it to college. Thankfully, I had a father who guided me on my business path and I put in the work to make it happen.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v79mxAhnuD4"></iframe></div></figure><p>There are so many that aren’t fortunate enough to have those role models in their lives, literally hundreds of thousands of kids out there that don’t have that guidance in their life. And in our own way, we want GRIND to play a positive role in the lives of these kids.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our mission and our branding, as a result, tries to tell that story and connect with young people in the basketball community and I think that’s a part of the reason why we’ve been successful in quickly establishing ourselves as a company.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>In terms of GRIND’s current tech stack, how difficult is it to work with a handful of providers?<br></h3><p>We’ve been fortunate in that we’ve come to work with many quality vendors. That’s provided us with a level of stability that any company would want. I, myself, am a creative “design guy” first and a “tech guy/engineer” second. So as I was piecing together this company, I needed to turn to people and companies with more expertise in their respective fields to succeed. We found folks like Clyde to handle our warranties and protection plans, software companies to handle our email outreach and a separate vendor to handle our website. Because we’re living in an era where there are these resources at your fingertips, all-in-all it’s been pretty smooth and allowed us to focus on our core business.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>What’s next for GRIND as you look to venture out beyond the machine itself?<br></h3><p>GRIND aspires to be a “Nike” of smart sports equipment. We want to build the kind of brand loyalty that those major brands have, and it all starts with building great products. It’s ultra important for us to make this first product as good as it can possibly be, so that we can use it as a foundation moving forward. Once you have that squared away you can expand the equipment offerings, the technology offerings and move into branded items like apparel. But it has to start with your current customers, making sure you’re giving them a top notch experience and using them to improve the product. If we get that right and really listen to our customers we have a chance to build that brand and expand our product offerings in the right way.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>How does GRIND target influencers to help grow their brand in the right way?<br></h3><p>Finding the right mix of brand ambassadors or influencers really comes down to the industry you’re working in and, in our case, the basketball community is filled with valuable influencers. Our target demo is in the 12-18 year-old range and that means our audience is living on their phones every day. Social media plays an enormous role in their lives and as a result, they’re looking up to and following influencers and trainers and athletes in a really meaningful way.&nbsp;</p><div></div><p>Because of our target age demo, the wide reach influencers in our space have with that age group and the ease with which we can become connected to these individuals, we feel as though this a worthwhile place to invest resources for our business.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With that being said, influencers won’t solve all your problems as a company or brand. We certainly don’t want to water down our brand with too many influencers, or run the risk of people only being familiar with our brand via said influencers. We want to have multiple touchpoints with our customers, so that we can maintain a strong identity that we are in control of at all times. For instance, our website and our social media channels allow us to provide an experience around our brand that we control. So at the end of the day, we want our brand to be boosted by an influencer instead of an influencer just happening to mention us alongside other brands. And you can only strike that balance by creating multiple connections with your customers and potential customers.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br><br></p>	Thu Feb 25 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese
Grow Direct-to-Consumer Revenue By Offering Product Protection	grow-direct-to-consumer-revenue-by-offering-product-protection	Grow Direct-to-Consumer Revenue By Offering Product Protection	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e17d0dfb04093e7d8b6a6b6_200108_d2c_blog.png	<p>Two of the biggest trends in retail over the past five years have been a shift to direct-to-consumer (DTC) selling, and the rise of omnichannel. While the word ‘omnichannel’ may have been used so many times at this point that it risks losing its meaning, there’s a reason it’s so popular. The proliferation of channels through which to purchase has made it crucial for retailers to create an integrated, cohesive customer experience. In addition, a focus on DTC selling—both for digitally native and traditional retailers—has meant higher margins and better data capture for brands.<br></p><p>Many of the ways in which brands can grow DTC revenue and offer better omnichannel experiences have been discussed ad nauseum at this point—from a seamless checkout experience to better personalization, creative fulfillment options, and even augmented reality.<br></p><p>But one that hasn’t yet been talked about as much is the importance of offering customers the option to purchase product protection—both in-store and online. Offering product protection has been a best practice of large, established retailers like Best Buy, Apple, Walmart, and Amazon for decades—in fact, it’s Best’s Buy’s most profitable business line. (See our brief history of product protection <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/brief-history-of-product-protection">here</a>.)<br></p><p>Most consumers will engage with your brand multiple times before making a bigger ticket purchase. According to the eCommerce Foundation’s “United States Ecommerce Country Report,” 88 percent of consumers pre-research their buys online before making a purchase either online or in-store. Creating a positive customer experience during this stage of the customer journey can help you stand out from the competition.<br></p><p>One way to differentiate during the research stage is by offering product protection. At this stage, a customer is more likely to purchase a product of interest from a retailer offering to cover that product against wear and tear and accidents than from one which doesn’t. Simply the option to purchase product protection signals to the customer that a retailer is invested in customer experience and satisfaction.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For a positive omnichannel experience, a customer should be able to purchase protection and file claims both in-store and online, as well as for a standard period (e.g. 30 days) post purchase. As more retail companies shift their focus to growing direct-to-consumer revenue, this option becomes even more crucial. For retailers whose products are sold by third parties (e.g. Amazon or Best Buy), the option to purchase product protection could mean the difference between that revenue coming directly to you rather than through a third party.<br></p><p>However, until recently, it’s been extremely difficult for smaller retailers to build a product protection offering. Insurance companies have a hard time onboarding new businesses. Businesses struggle to connect products to plans and to connect plans to their store. And customers don’t understand terms and conditions, or how to make claims. But when protection plans work for retailers and customers, they can make all the difference in cultivating a positive customer experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Shameless plug ahead: this is one reason we built Clyde. Clyde’s platform makes it easy for retailers to match their products with the best protection plans and offer them to customers at any touchpoint. What was once only an option for retail giants like Walmart, Amazon, and Best Buy is now a seamless process for all retailers.

How Back to School Is Changing	how-back-to-school-is-changing	How Back-to-School Is Changing	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f21f3f13f089747ac2bda6e_School%20-%20Option%2001.png	<p>Back-to-school looks different this year.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Jugs of hand sanitizer are stocked next to the college-ruled notebooks in the school supply section. Teachers are racing to prepare virtual-friendly lesson plans alongside their regular ones. And students of all ages, from kindergarteners to college seniors, are getting ready to approach learning in a different way—and with different tools.<br></p><p>In the U.S., there’s no one way that schools are opening. Some school districts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/13/us/lausd-san-diego-school-reopening.html">already confirmed</a> they’ll be going fully virtual for the fall, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Nashville, and Atlanta. Others are planning to open, though only two of the country’s 10 largest school districts meet <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/coronavirus-schools-fall.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article">epidemiologists’ agreed-upon goal</a> of having daily infection rates of less than 5%. As <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/when-will-school-open-here-s-state-state-list-t179718">each state finalizes its fall plans</a>, one thing is clear: remote learning will play a major role in kids going back to school this fall.<br></p><p>From a retail perspective, that means unprecedented changes in back-to-school shopping habits. Here’s what we anticipate seeing in the sector.<br></p><h3>Parents and school districts alike will spend more money<br></h3><p>Colored pencils and graph paper won’t cut it this year. To enable kids to connect and learn from home, technology that was formerly a nice-to-have is now necessary.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In many cases, school districts themselves will be the buyers. <a href="https://edsource.org/2020/california-schools-must-provide-daily-live-interaction-access-to-technology-this-fall/634452">California’s Department of Education plans to buy 300,000 wifi hotspots</a>, for instance, in order to enable students to connect from home.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But in families with the extra income, parents are planning to supplement their home setup to better facilitate learning, with 40% of parents planning to buy less-traditional supplies like technology and 51% planning to increase spending on virtual learning tools to the tune of over $500 per household (per <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/retail-distribution/back-to-school-survey.html?id=us:2el:3pr:4di6646:5awa:6di:070820:&pkid=1007027">Deloitte’s July back-to-school survey</a>). The <a href="https://nrf.com/insights/holiday-and-seasonal-trends/back-school">National Retail Federation</a> found the top three largest parent expenditures to be computers (with 72% planning to buy), laptops (36%), and accessories like speakers and headphones (22%).<br></p><p>16 states are holding <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/16-states-hold-tax-holidays-for-school-supplies-amid-coronavirus-2020-7">back-to-school “tax holidays”</a> to help reduce the cost of school supplies. During the tax holiday period, shoppers are exempt from paying local and sometimes state taxes on items like notebooks and laptop computers.<br></p><h3><strong>Software spending will see a spike, especially when there’s no one dominant product</strong><br></h3><p>It shouldn’t surprise you that Zoom saw <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/02/zoom-stock-climbs-on-massive-earnings-beat.aspx">78% growth</a> last quarter. The video chat software has very much cornered the market on all the pandemic-era communicating we’re doing. It’s likely to continue to perform well as schools go virtual, along with competitors like Google Hangouts and WebEx.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Other software likely to see spikes in sales include classroom management tools like Google Classroom and Top Hat that help teachers create and execute lesson plans and collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams that allow educators and administrators to connect and plan together.<br></p><h3><strong>Hardware sales will go up—and up and up</strong><br></h3><p>In 2017, 80% <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/25/a-third-of-americans-live-in-a-household-with-three-or-more-smartphones/">of American households</a> owned a desktop or laptop computer—and the median number of such devices per household was one.<br></p><p>With parents and kids all working and studying from home, equipment needs have expanded significantly, and sales are following.<br></p><p>A Verge report found that even with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21279633/laptop-pc-shortages-supply-chain-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic">issues in the supply chain</a> leading to delayed order fulfillment, retailers are still seeing increased traffic to laptop product pages of 100-130% and sales spikes of up to 40% higher than usual.<br></p><p>Specific growth areas include:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Laptops and netbooks to provide access, especially when it comes to lower-priced models like Chromebooks (which </strong><a href="https://www.kgns.tv/2020/07/20/local-school-districts-prepare-for-distance-learning/"><strong>some school districts are buying in the thousands</strong></a><strong>)</strong></li><li><strong>Wifi hotspots </strong>to support increased streaming and video needs</li><li><strong>Tablets and smartphones, particularly wifi-enabled ones that can serve as a hotspot if needed (</strong><a href="https://edsource.org/2020/a-look-at-distance-learning-strategies-for-success-edsource-webinar/631433"><strong>Miami-Dade distributed tens of thousands</strong></a><strong> of such phones to help track when students were logging in)</strong><br></li></ul><h3><strong>Accessories and furniture sales likely to increase, too</strong><br></h3><p>Other remote-learning-friendly tech likely to see spikes in sales include noise-cancelling headphones, webcams, e-readers, and external hard drives.<br></p><p>Furniture makers—including and especially those who offer desks and desk chairs, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/wayfair-shares-surge-37percent-as-coronavirus-drives-sales-of-office-furniture.html">like Wayfair</a>—have already seen major spikes in sales, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-20/working-from-home-coronavirus-drives-long-lasting-change">Bloomberg report</a> on the industry expects the market to sustain higher sales even after the virus fades.<br></p><p>After all, remote learning is hard enough. Logging into science class from an actual desk and not a cramped corner of the couch seems like a pretty good idea.<br></p><h3><strong>Online learning is here for a while</strong><br></h3><p>With families and school districts investing major money in getting students equipped to learn in a remote environment, protecting those products with an extended warranty plan is a good idea. Retailers who offer product production are giving customers peace of mind and helping them to confidently use the products they need—a welcome gift always, and especially so during a pandemic.</p><p><br></p>	Thu Jul 30 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
How COVID Is Boosting E-Commerce and Extended Warranty Sales	how-covid-is-boosting-e-commerce-and-extended-warranty-sales	How COVID Is Boosting E-Commerce and Extended Warranty Sales	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f04726e8b892360cffcb3fe_COVIDBlog.png	<p>You’ve probably seen the <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/adobe-covid-19-spurs-spike-in-e-commerce/577873/">headlines</a> about how COVID-related social distancing and sheltering in place has led to a spike in e-commerce sales.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Although unemployment is still (and will continue to be) a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/28/jobless-america-unemployment-coronavirus-in-figures">major issue</a>, some people have found themselves with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-relief-often-pays-workers-more-than-work-11588066200">more cash on hand</a>, whether that’s from reduced spending on entertainment, stimulus checks, or expanded unemployment benefits. And some of that money has made its way into increased e-commerce sales.</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f035076a580d69f82b3b1e7_ttBPqeck7Ho6VaJtHMpfUCHsSYWSnpf0tWXzevOffWolK3e-7Q0nUw7GiSiVlewmKo5gY1BS1niOPI6rioZS0WWBOfjuKP6zBhRmit7KWfhyKa8x26a9lq5HsMVa9zruOB1jKhAh.png"></div><figcaption>"'<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/11/business/economy/coronavirus-us-economy-spending.html">How the Virus Transformed the&nbsp;Way Americans Spend Their Money</a>,' The New York Times"</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>A <a href="https://ccinsight.org/observations/us-retailers-see-online-growth-yoy-in-april-similar-to-recent-holiday-season/">CC Insight study</a> found that e-commerce sales grew 68% from April 2019 to 2020, which was significantly higher than the previous year-over-year growth record of 49% hit in January (which included holiday season growth). The April all-time high is particularly notable considering that overall spending is down, with US spending seeing a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/29/us-savings-rate-hits-record-33percent-as-coronavirus-causes-americans-to-stockpile-cash-curb-spending.html">record 13.6% decline</a> in April.<br></p><p>As e-commerce has spiked, so have sales of extended warranties. That didn’t surprise us, but we wanted to understand exactly where and how it was happening, so we dug into sales of Clyde’s fully-integrated extended warranty contracts from before COVID (January 1 to March 15) and after (March 15 to May 31).<br></p><h3><strong>COVID has almost doubled extended warranty sales&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>In looking at sales data over the last five months, we found a meaningful uptick in attachment rates (“AR”), or the percentage of eligible product orders where consumers also purchased an extended warranty, after the COVID crisis began.<br></p><p>Overall, AR almost doubled in the period, with especially notable spikes in the following areas, all of which tend to be higher-priced purchases:<br></p><ul><li>Appliances, where AR more than doubled&nbsp;</li><li>Electronics, where AR increased 60%&nbsp;</li><li>Furniture, where AR increased 20%&nbsp;</li><li>Jewelry, where AR more than tripled<br></li></ul><p>Psychological research can help us understand what’s driving those increases and why more consumers are choosing to invest in product protection and extended warranties.<br></p><h3><strong>What drives consumers to buy differently in times of crisis</strong><br></h3><p>As humans, we tend to have a pretty strong optimism bias. We assume bad things won’t happen to us until they do. (That’s why we go outside without always slathering ourselves in sunscreen, even though we know we’re risking skin cancer. Or at least why I do that.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Living through a very obviously bad thing, like the current coronavirus crisis, forces us to confront the fact that those unpleasant realities can and do happen. As our optimism bias erodes and we are able to more realistically process the risks and possible negative outcomes facing us, we respond by preparing for them. That can include investing in extended warranties, disinfecting our groceries, and yes, putting on sunscreen.<br></p><p>Peter Noel Murray, a consumer psychologist in New York, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/heres-why-people-are-panic-buying-and-stockpiling-toilet-paper.html">spoke to CNBC</a> about the way our brains work to process stress. When we’re in situations we can’t control—like, say, a pandemic that has no end in sight—”the mind deals with it through [seeking] control,” he explained. Paul Marsden, a consumer psychologist at the University of the Arts London, noted that changes in purchasing patterns may be driven by several psychological needs, including:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>. Feeling in control of our actions becomes even more important during a pandemic that you <em>definitely </em>cannot control. After all, though we can’t stop a virus, we can stock a pantry. Marsden explains that some purchases may be a way for consumers to practice agency and autonomy on a small scale. Extended warranties, in particular, might be a way for buyers to invest in their autonomy, since they know they’ll be covered if something goes wrong.</li><li><strong>Relatedness</strong>. Wanting to feel like we’re doing something to help our families and communities can have a direct impact on purchasing. Maybe we can’t protect our loved ones from the threat of a virus, but we can definitely make extended time at home more comfortable with new game consoles and furniture. Product protection could help our need for relatedness even more, allowing us to know that our forward planning will help us look out for our families if issues come up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Competence</strong>. We want to see ourselves as good people making good decisions—like doing the responsible thing and buying product protection along with an expensive new toy.<br></li></ul><p>Extended warranty options have always given more control and peace of mind to consumers. It’s understandable that buyers are looking for even more of that right now.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What does all this mean for retailers?</strong><br></h3><p>Our current reality isn’t likely to change anytime soon, and retailers should be ready for that.<br></p><p>An <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/10/consumer-expectations-normal-activities-comfortable/">April 2020 study</a> found that less than 16% of people said they would feel comfortable shopping at a mall in the next three months—and that was before the numbers of new cases in the U.S. rose to<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/02/coronavirus-live-updates-us/"> over 50,000 a day</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If we look to countries that are months ahead of the States in dealing with the virus, we see that changes to purchasing patterns are probably here to stay. A <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/4-new-shopping-trends-in-post-lockdown-china">June 2020 report</a> from the World Economic Forum found that although countries like China are already returning to “normal,” shifts to online purchasing that started during the pandemic’s peak have remained.<br></p><p>E-commerce and increased interest in extended warranties are here to stay. Retailers should be poised to make the most of those changes. Consider streamlining your purchasing process, improving your site’s performance on multiple platforms, and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">partnering with Clyde</a> to offer extended warranty options and the peace of mind that comes with them.</p><p><br><br></p>	Tue Jul 07 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
How Democratizing Data Drives eCommerce Teams Forward	how-democratizing-data-drives-ecommerce-teams-forward	How Democratizing Data Drives eCommerce Teams Forward	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f7b7c50d1b4253da64d17ac_How%20Democratizing%20Data%20Drives%20eCommerce%20Teams%20Forward%20-%20Opt%201%20(1).png	<p>It's no secret that data is a vital business tool, especially when running an online store.</p><p>Data drives decision-making at various levels within a company by showing what works and what does not. When you have control over the 4Vs of big data, volume, velocity, variety, and value, you can make decisions to propel your eCommerce business forward.</p><p>However, how can you ensure you have access to data, especially if you're a non-technical user? Do you need a data scientist to address your data needs in a small business? How can you ensure that all teams in your eCommerce business have access to data for fast decision-making without an IT department or your involvement?</p><p>Data democratization allows you to answer these questions.</p><h2><strong>What Is Data Democratization?</strong></h2><p>Data democratization is the process of making data available to all operational teams in your business, including non-technical users, without involving an IT expert, and in a form that's easy to understand to expedite decision-making.</p><p>Democratizing data removes all bottlenecks and gate-keepers to data, which ensures that your teams have a competitive advantage.</p><h2><strong>Old World Vs. New World of eCommerce Data</strong></h2><p>XaaS, which is a general term to refer to everything-as-a-service, is a vital agility-booster for many businesses. It covers all aspects of cloud computing that allow businesses to enjoy the benefits of tech over the cloud. You can access storage, software, desktop, and data services all over the internet. This is simultaneously aligned with eliminating gatekeepers and frustrating siloes that many commerce companies built when trying to contain the rapid rise of data.</p><p>This new trend allows eCommerce businesses to store and analyze data without having to worry about the high overhead costs of establishing on-premise services. You no longer need to purchase licenses and pay annual subscriptions for services you could require for a month, or purchase servers for your business. What's more, the cost of ensuring the safety of your data, hiring IT experts, and being in-line with relevant data regulations is mostly transferred to the vendor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This shift to cloud computing has primarily contributed to the democratization of data. For instance, you can allow all your employees to access a platform with data analytics, <a href="https://www.yaguara.co/blog/introducing-dashboards-the-best-way-to-visualize-your-data-and-ongoing-goals">dashboards for visualization</a>, collaboration, sharable insights, metrics, updates, and document sharing, all from different geographical locations.</p><p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020/">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2024, 75% of enterprises will shift to utilizing AI techniques to enhance learning, data distribution, and analytics. Technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing are improving the speed and efficiency of computers in absorbing and analyzing data for the non-technical user.</p><h2><strong>What eCommerce Areas Stand To Improve From Data Democratization?</strong></h2><h3><strong>Omnichannel Sales</strong></h3><p><a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/a-study-of-46000-shoppers-shows-that-omnichannel-retailing-works">73%</a> of consumers use multiple channels to access e-commerce services. How can you ensure that your customers have access to the same quality of services, whether shopping on mobile, a laptop, or any online device?</p><p>Data democratization ensures that all teams, whether managing technical, marketing, or sales aspects of your eCommerce store, make decisions together for the benefit of the consumer. By sharing data, analytics, and views, you can ensure that consumers have a similar experience across all channels.</p><h3><strong>Product Improvements</strong></h3><p>Another major benefit of data democratization is the ability to drive product quality or assortment improvements. At many retailers, data on product sell-through may be siloed within the Merchandising or Finance departments, while customer feedback may be siloed within Customer Support teams. Bringing this data together and sharing it across the organization is crucial for understanding customers’ needs and where product quality may be falling short.</p><h3><strong>Paid Acquisition</strong></h3><p>Data democratization helps your team access the information on any paid traffic endeavors you undertake. Whether you choose to take up Google Ads to improve your brand visibility and promote sales, or social media ads such as Facebook Ads to attract potential clients, data democratization helps you manage the results while keeping the whole team in the loop.</p><p>Your marketing efforts and data don't become the sole property of the marketing department. Sure, not all departments will understand the technicalities of marketing, but they'll see the efforts and understand the results of a paid ad.</p><p>What's more, they'll respond accordingly. The customer service department can gear up for quick and effective responses, the sales team can step in with the right promotions and sales, and you can ensure that everything runs smoothly.</p><h2><strong>The Four Results of Democratized Data</strong></h2><h3><strong>Alignment</strong></h3><p>How can you ensure that all employees and teams in your eCommerce business are playing the same symphony? That each beat drops, and each player moves their strings at the right moment? Data democratization helps you align different teams in your business by providing reliable, updated, and similar information. You can make decisions based on the most current data and in communication with other teams.</p><p>For example, your marketing team can organize campaigns that achieve the sales team's goals, and data from the sales department can help the marketing team create personalized ads for consumers at various points of the sale's funnel. The finance department can also ensure that they fund the marketing department based on reliable metrics to prevent delays.</p><h3><strong>Confidence</strong></h3><p>Information boosts your confidence because it helps you make decisions based on the latest facts and analysis of your business. You'll feel more confident setting goals and objectives for your business when you're aware of your current position, growth rate, and possible achievements.</p><p>What's more, your employees also feel more confident when making decisions based on accurate data. They can also back-up their decisions with reliable facts.</p><h3><strong>Speed</strong></h3><p>Access to data helps you and all employees make swift decisions. You can trust your delegates to make decisions for daily operations without consulting the management, as long as it's within their jurisdiction. Fast decisions at the employee level reduce bureaucracy and save critical time.</p><h3><strong>Outcomes</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.yaguara.co/blog/making-data-a-reality-in-the-new-ecommerce-world">Data-driven decision making</a> ensures that you make unbiased decisions for the improvement of your business. Relying on your intuition may be excellent for certain circumstances, but data helps you measure your decision against an outcome. You can measure the impact of several business decisions and see how changing one aspect could impact several parts of your eCommerce store.</p><p>With accurate analytics, you can look into cost savings, consumer responses to product launches, sales patterns based on various prices, and also analyze customer reviews for improved customer services. There's no need to play guessing games when you can measure the impact of each decision and also collect data on competitors to boost your business.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>At <a href="https://www.yaguara.co/">Yaguara</a>, we take the guessing out of decision-making and ensure that every team member has access to fast and reliable data. Our platform helps you share analyzed data for every worker to draw insights, make decisions, and contribute to team projects.

How eCommerce Technology Works Together	how-ecommerce-technology-works-together	How eCommerce Technology Works Together	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61ddf6d036233ba2bf520a73_Microservices%20Jigsaw%20Puzzle%204.png	<p>17.3%.<br></p><p>That’s how much <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-ecommerce-forecast-2021">analysts predict</a> U.S. eComm sales will grow in 2022.<br></p><p>And it’s four times faster than the rest of the economy’s growth rate; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/04/economy/goldman-sachs-us-gdp-omicron/index.html">Goldman Sach’s U.S. GDP growth forecast</a> is set at 3.8%.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This growth rate has money pouring into the industry. Investment in eComm initiatives grew 31% from the first quarter of 2021 to the second, per <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/nacelle-series-b-funding/">CBInsights</a>, hitting a high of $16.9B.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Those investments are feeding innovation in every stage of an eComm sale, from customer acquisition to payment to retention.&nbsp;<br></p><p>One of the biggest trends?<br></p><p>A movement away from monoliths and towards microservices.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For a while now, enterprise eCommerce companies have been leaning away from building everything in-house on one centralized architecture and instead <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-real-price-tag-of-a-bought-not-built-tech-stack-and-a-way-to-slash-it">buying a more nimble tech stack</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.cmswire.com/information-management/7-tech-giants-embracing-microservices/">Amazon, eBay, and Groupon</a> all have moved towards a microservice architecture in the last few years. eBay’s CTO <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3041064/what-ebay-looks-like-under-the-hood.html">told reporters back in 2016</a> that the eComm giant was using more than 1,000 microservices, and that through those microservices, the company was able to provide better customer experiences in everything from inventory management to checkout.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And now with a new crop of startups offering even more nimble, customizable, and reliable microservices, it’s worth understanding how a microservice architecture works.&nbsp;</p><h2>Understanding What an eCommerce Microservice Architecture Is</h2><p>Microservices are small, independent pieces of software that communicate with other pieces of software via APIs. APIs are Application Programming Interfaces, or connectivity interfaces between applications.</p><p>A microservice architecture is a collection of applications that each fulfill different functions but talk to each other. In contrast, a monolithic architecture is a centralized, closed system where different functions are completed by a single program and via a single platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Think of it like streaming services. Back in the day, if you were lucky enough to not have a cable monopoly in your area, you had maybe two companies to choose from. Those companies provided all of your channels, and if there was a cable outage, you couldn’t watch anything at all.</p><p>Now, consumers have the choice of dozens of different streaming services, each offering specific, different programming. If for some reason Disney+ is down, you could still watch whatever’s on Hulu, HBO Max, or Netflix. And each one of those streamers integrates seamlessly into your smart TV, so you can access them all in the same place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Putting aside any nostalgia for the days of channel-surfing, this microservice wave has provided eComm companies with the ability to create what can best be described as a "plugable"&nbsp;website. By selecting the best third-party plugins, these companies are adaptable and have the ability to incorporate the best the tech market has to offer, which ultimately can lead to a better customer experience.</p><p>In the same way that a system comprised of microservices can be more nimble and economical by incorporating many best-in-class plugins or external services, Clyde is offering retailers plugins and services that provide warranties and protection plans programs. While not a microservice itself, the Clyde platform offers the flexibility, in-house expertise and profitability of an outsourced solution in a plugable way. For this reason, launching a program with Clyde can take as little as day, providing a very attractive time-to-value proposition for the retailers that use it. </p><h3>Why are Microservice Architectures Replacing Monolithic Architectures?</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:40%"><a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/WP-TechTailwinds.html" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61ddf8604096bd45fafd1d08_Tech%20Tailwinds.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>Is your tech stack still a financial anchor that is only viewed as a line item, a mere cost of doing business? What if you could create a cashflow-positive tech stack? What kinds of opportunities would that open up for your business? Learn more <a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/WP-TechTailwinds.html">here</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Microservice architectures are replacing monolithic architectures because the former allows for much more customizable growth. Monolithic architectures mean taking down an entire site when one part of it isn’t performing, or being forced to code new applications in a language or an environment that’s not suited to them, or spending tons of time doing manual testing before rolling out updates to make sure a deployment will work as planned. They also require significant IT resources to build, maintain, and evolve.</p><p>Microservices get around that. They’re decentralized, easier to deploy, and can be worked on simultaneously.</p><p>One of our customers, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/customer-stories/autobrush">Cori Taylor at Autobrush</a>, explains why they chose to use Clyde, instead of building and operating their own warranty program: “We did not have the manpower, time, or risk appetite to build something [in-house] that already exists…All of our software buying decisions are based on a gap in customer experience. If we can’t find a solution in-house, we start looking for other solutions.”</p><h2>The Benefits of Implementing Microservices&nbsp;</h2><p>Succeeding in eCommerce is all about anticipating and solving customers’ needs.<br></p><p>Microservices are the easiest way to continuously do that.<br></p><p>Here are some of the specific benefits that microservices bring to ecomm vendors:<br></p><ul><li>Specialization. Microservices let you find the exact thing you’re looking for, without having to build a kind-of, sort-of functional version with the same language as the rest of your site. Does an inventor management widget need tons of server time to run calcs? You might build that in Java, even if your plug-in to manage product photos relies on Ruby.&nbsp;</li><li>Custom scaling. With a microservice architecture, you don’t have to scale your frontend and backend at the same time. You can deploy developers to the former, to roll out new features to respond to heavy traffic, without having to scale the entire application at the same time.&nbsp;</li><li>Improved resilience. Without a single point of failure, your site is less vulnerable. For example, if your search feature breaks, customers can still successfully check out while you’re getting it fixed—your whole site doesn’t need to go offline.&nbsp;</li><li>Easier maintenance. Microservices are managed by the teams that deploy them. With smaller codebases and a more direct connection between the customers using the service and the IT supporting it, your developers will have an easier time fixing problems when they come up.&nbsp;</li><li>Faster improvements. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce">Shopify</a> expects to see record ecommerce competition in 2022. Winners will be the companies who can offer <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce/brand-development">rich, immersive experiences</a>, from slick product pages to customized offerings. Microservices are faster to deploy and can be worked on independently. If you want to add a reviews tool to your product page, for instance, your product team can get that up and running without having to involve the payment team.</li></ul><h2>Types of Microservices Available</h2><p>If you can dream it, it exists as a microservice.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Whether you build your own microservices or take advantage of already-existing solutions, these tiny solutions can work for user management, product management, order management, payment management, and other aspects of an ecommerce application or website.</p><h3>Enhanced Search Microservices</h3><p><a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/MustHave-eCommerce-Features/RES89561">4 out of every 10</a> eCommerce buyers go directly to the search bar. If your site’s or app’s search features aren’t well-developed, you’re losing out on sales.<br></p><p>Again, you can build your own search service, which would require building and accessing an index.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Or you can use already-existing microservices like <a href="https://www.elasticpress.io/">Elasticsearch</a>, which helps Wordpress sites offer faster, more complete search.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> offers similar features, including AI-powered search, and integrates with platforms like Shopify and Salesforce Commerce Cloud</p><h3>Product Catalog Microservices</h3><p>Per <a href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/new-product-launch">Shopify</a>, eCommerce stores that launch new products can see higher sales and conversions and increased brand awareness.<br></p><p>Managing an ever-changing product catalog can be a pain, though, which is why many eCommerce vendors outsource their catalog management to a microservice like <a href="https://www.shopify.com/retail/new-product-launch">Sales Layer</a> or <a href="https://www.salsify.com/">Salsify</a>. Both services help with product information management (PIM) by collecting and personalizing product information across channels.</p><h3>Payment Microservices</h3><p>Cash. Check. Credit card. Those are pretty much all of the payment options available to a shopper in a regular brick-and-mortar store. Checkout is handled by one cashier with one register and one credit card machine, and that’s it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But what if your eCommerce buyers want to pay with cryptocurrency? Or with a buy now, pay later (BNPL) program? Or split their payments across multiple credit cards? Or pay with a digital Paypal wallet? Or apply different discount codes to different parts of an order?<br></p><p>Not having multiple payment options means leaving money on the table. Per the Federal Reserve, online spending on some ecomm categories, including grocery and general merchandise marketplaces, <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/cash/publications/fed-notes/2021/may/2021-findings-from-the-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice/">nearly doubled in 2020</a>, going from $110 to $212 per purchase.<br></p><p>Adding payment microservices like <a href="https://boldcommerce.com/">Bold Commerce</a> can help you customize a seamless payment and checkout experience that gives your customers the options they want.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.chargebee.com/">Chargebee</a> is a great option for eCommerce sellers who offer subscriptions. It scales across international currencies and taxes and lets you customize pricing by customer segments.&nbsp;</p><h3>Warranty and Product Protection Microservices</h3><p>To earn a sale, merchants have to pass multiple levels. Does their product do what the customer is looking for? Is the price right? Does it come recommended by peers? What are the shipping options? What’s the return policy?<br></p><p>And increasingly importantly: is there an extended warranty offered?<br></p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-product-protection-increases-customer-ltv-and-drives-loyalty">Assurant found</a> that offering extended warranties can increase a customer’s intent to buy by about 25%. That helps merchants win more sales while also giving customers greater peace of mind.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Clyde</a> can help, offering everything from product protection to accident coverage via simple integration into existing product and payment flows.&nbsp;</p><h2>Clyde: Your eCommerce Product Protection Microservice</h2><p>Ready to deploy a microservice that can <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/customer-loyalty">drive customer lifetime value</a>, AOV, and customer experience, all at once?<br></p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Schedule a demo with Clyde.&nbsp;</a><br></p>	Tue Jan 11 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

Examining the value of warranty programs, the key measures of success are CX and operational efficiency. Operational efficiency that works in earnest doesn’t cut corners. Instead it comes as teams find and adopt better ways to build on the basics. With efficiency and CX in mind, Apple, Walmart and Amazon partner with product insurers to offer product protection in addition to manufacturers’ warranties. These four reasons are why:</p><ol data-w-id="a6e0f743-200f-c653-75a7-1905f356d411"><li data-w-id="01aefe43-2057-3b59-48a8-7ca0cfb521a6"><strong data-w-id="bdab2437-1c52-2d28-35df-ccfdce28f78b">Risk removal</strong><br data-w-id="765dba2e-c055-0dbe-ce50-05749806d45f">All retailers want to guarantee value.

These warranties often cover product defects and merchantability - ensuring that new products sold look and function as new products should. They may also outline a limited set of circumstances under which the product can be either repaired or replaced.&nbsp;<br data-w-id="6c93850d-4b37-d84e-f291-e977761f8784"></p><h3 data-w-id="06cdb38c-9c35-7f07-dc3e-21de7533aaca"><em data-w-id="809935fc-6ccb-5f9c-c120-05a9f2ac8cc1">Self-insured extended warranty</em></h3><p data-w-id="855ddcc7-42ef-e5eb-0b6d-6cc569f7cad8">Self-insured extended warranties may be purchased by customers who want to protect the value of their purchase for longer than a manufacturer’s warranty may provide. By sticking to the provisions of that original warranty, the greatest addition a store-managed extended warranty offers is time. In this instance, the store takes on the potential risk of paying for repairs and replacements.<br data-w-id="9be4041d-4f07-fd3b-c340-236afb5c0335"></p><h3 data-w-id="e967eb38-0b50-3a4c-df46-984f0a1fa28f"><em data-w-id="15511839-6ec3-b8d6-4259-c048795605d6">Clyde Product Protection</em></h3><p data-w-id="dd84228a-7c7e-e746-875e-0e811e51e660">The greatest shift from self-insured extended warranties to product protection is a change in liability. Committing to repair or replace products is a financial risk. Product protection is backed by an outside insurer who takes on that risk. This liability is taken in exchange for an insurance premium that customers pay as a one-time fee. Homeowner’s insurance and car insurance are both great examples of this practice in related industries. The only difference is that homes and cars are much larger expenses than the average over-the-counter product, so those premiums are much larger and can be paid monthly.&nbsp;</p><p data-w-id="e80c0276-aa25-72b5-5211-ad79689a3898">As a function of accessing product insurers, third-party product insurance comes with a dedicated outside admin team that provides customer service.

ADH protection is more robust coverage than your standard manufacturer’s warranty. Depending on the insurer and the needs of the product sold, ADH protection can be expanded to include a wide range of coverage options. In line with the product protection above, ADH coverage includes a dedicated admin team to care for customer needs. ADH product protection gives peace of mind, assuring customers that they are protected from life’s what ifs and mishaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br data-w-id="839ac064-831a-7c4b-7b2a-e5dc90f882e9"></p><h2 data-w-id="da7cd34e-6e42-0936-e857-72f55bfee5c8">Why Clyde?&nbsp;</h2><p data-w-id="483c8396-a0e4-6639-11dd-7c3911c6f7dd">Clyde product protection plans are insured and administered by the same institutional insurers that have been behind the product insurance industry for decades.

How Product Protection Increases Customer LTV and Drives Loyalty	how-product-protection-increases-customer-ltv-and-drives-loyalty	How Product Protection Increases Customer LTV and Drives Loyalty	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614b34335a8051535ac9b7b0_New%20Customer%20Loyalty%203.jpg	<p>Clyde exists for two reasons: to help merchants deliver incredible ownership experiences to their customers, while empowering those same customers to extract the full value of every item they purchase. Both of these objectives are achieved through product protection.<br></p><h3><strong>What is product protection?</strong></h3><p>Clyde product protection comes in a few forms:<br></p><p>1. Extended warranties - They start when the manufacturer warranty expires and then extend the coverage of mechanical or electrical malfunctions for a specified time. These plans are backed by insurance companies, not the manufacturer.&nbsp;<br></p><p>2. Protection plans - Coverage for specified damages or accidents. A common plan is the accidental damage from handling (ADH), which covers damage caused by accidents like drops, breaks and spills. Think Applecare.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>How does offering product protection help me increase the value of my customer?</strong><br></h3><p>Profit margins are becoming thinner for eCommerce merchants, especially in categories like electronics and appliances where everyone is shopping around for the lowest possible price. Offering a protection plan with these purchases increases your order value with little to no overhead. These plans are the highest margin SKU many of our merchants sell. Retailers who offer extended warranties through Clyde see average purchase orders increase by 11%.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:25%"><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/8-upselling-examples-and-tips-that-increase-order-values" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/611427f1b9b1abac241886f4_Upselling%20Artwork%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>8 Upselling Examples and Tips that Increase Order Values</figcaption></figure><p>The presence of an extended warranty offering can also act as a badge of trust on your products and give consumers the additional peace of mind they need to purchase a high price item. Assurant found that extended warranties, on average, increase a consumer’s intent to buy by about 25%. This increased trust can lead to increased conversion rates and create a loyal customer who knows your company has made it a priority to be there for them when they need you most -- if something goes wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>“With third-party marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart, as well as big box retailers like Target for example, offering up product protection on eligible products, we’ve seen an increase in the expectation that consumers have of brands. A few years ago, product protection and warranties were a ‘nice to have’ to stay competitive, but now they’re a ‘need to have’ if merchants want to compete with the major players on the market,” says Chloe Fisher, Director of Agency Partnerships at Clyde.<br></p><h3><strong>Now that you’ve acquired these customers and optimized their average order value, how do you keep them coming back?</strong><br></h3><p>One challenge faced by retailers is the cost to acquire new customers (CAC), especially with the new data rules in place. That’s why it's more important than ever to know your customers who purchase from third party channels (e.g. Amazon) and to provide an exceptional D2C customer experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In order to provide a seamless customer experience from start to finish, you need to prioritize customer service and provide a positive claims experience. The same thoughtful attention you put into a frictionless purchase process should be mirrored in your claims process. Clyde’s digital first process allows your customers to access their product purchase history and warranty information, all in plain English, and lets them file a claim directly - no printing, no receipts, no mailing things in, and all with real-time updates.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><a href="https://www.midwestecommerceseminar.com/?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=partner&utm_term=mes2021&utm_campaign=clyde" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614cb73d1fc06d5b374e3218_MES%20Email%20Banner%20-%20Clyde.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a></figure><p>‍<br>“Good research tells us that one in every three customers would leave a brand they love after just <a href="https://www.pwc.com/future-of-cx">one negative experience</a>,” says Fisher. “Furthermore, 92% of customers would completely abandon a brand after two or three negative experiences. When we think about the products we love and use regularly, none of us want those products to break. But we’re human- accidents happen. We have kids who throw remote controls at our new flatscreen or we spill coffee on our laptop. It’s not that the product is bad, it’s that the user is human. But it’s in these moments, where something breaks or goes wrong, that we have the power to either win or lose that customer for life. If we can provide a customer with a positive, tailored claims experience and leave them with positive feelings about our brand, we’re able to recover the cost of actually acquiring that customer in the first place”.<br></p><p>No matter what happens with the product, this interaction creates a positive experience and creates another meaningful touch point between you and your customers, building their brand loyalty and putting you top of mind when it’s time to make another purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Once you have these people in your marketable database you can continue communicating with them, building out customer groups and advertising products that might be of interest to them.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In addition to driving passive revenue and generating happy repeat customers you can also use the data on protection plan sales, available in your Clyde dashboard, to help drive improvements in marketing, product development, customer service, and pretty much every other part of your company.<br></p>	Wed Sep 22 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

Or they can provide a better experience.</p><p>Consider Amazon’s<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-amazon-reach-across-markets/"> huge economies of scale</a>.

How the Customer Experience has Improved in the Warranty Space	how-the-customer-experience-has-improved-in-the-warranty-space	How the Customer Experience has Improved in the Warranty Space	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e4184a42c92130fc9c91010_200206-Customer-Experience.jpg	<p>Customer experience is everything in retail. Beyond just the product or service, the experience a brand offers has become a critical factor in determining how and where consumers allocate wallet share. Expectations around the customer experience have drastically increased, and the warranty space has in turn responded with major improvements. With the addition of some new, highly customer-centric players, the warranty space’s customer experience has benefitted from a huge increase in transparency and accountability.<br></p><p>Here are three ways transparency and accountability have improved the customer experience in the warranty space:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>1. Policies are written in clear, plain terms.</h3><p>At their core, extended warranties and protection plans are contracts. However, just because they are contracts should not mean that you should need to retain legal counsel before purchasing one. Extended warranties and protection plans are increasingly being written in easily understandable terms so that consumers know exactly what they are buying and what will be covered. Clyde is making sure that there is never confusion about what is and is not covered under a given extended warranty or protection plan.</p><h3>2. The claims experience is a breeze.<br></h3><p>Customers buy extended warranties and protection plans to cover the purchases they care most about. So, if something does happen and a customer needs to file a claim, the claim experience absolutely should not be any more stressful than the loss of use of a favorite item. An emphasis on transparency has improved the claims experience in a few ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p>First, filing a claim has become super simple. Dedicated customer portals, like on hiclyde.com, offer an intuitive filing experience that eliminates the need for lots of paperwork and jumping through hoops just to report an issue or defect. Second, these portals also provide the transparency of real-time claim tracking, keeping customers in the loop throughout the claims process. The transparency offered by Clyde has increased the accountability of insurance companies, ensuring that the claims experience is always positive and never more stressful than the actual loss of use of an important object.</p><h3>3. Protection plans are widely available and pricing is highly competitive.</h3><p>Historically, only the biggest retailers have had the resources to offer their customers extended warranties and product protection plans. However, technology companies like Clyde have partnered with insurance companies to make it possible for <em>all</em> retailers to offer their customers these options. This advancement has empowered consumers to shop wherever they like with an expectation they can receive the same caliber of service everywhere. Plus, by leveraging a network of insurance partners, rather than relying on just one, Clyde increases accountability to guarantee that customers receive the best service and the most competitive pricing.<br></p><p>While historically, the warranty space has been marred by criticism for its less-than-stellar customer experience, new players are stepping up and rewriting the narrative. Thanks to a focus on transparency and a greater sense of accountability, the customer experience in the warranty space has and continues to improve tremendously.</p><p><br></p>	Tue Feb 11 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jacob-stein
How To Cultivate Influencers and Brand Partnerships	how-to-cultivate-influencers-and-brand-partnerships	How To Cultivate Influencers and Brand Partnerships	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/605b7a4f00b9d35d7953e50b_Influencer%20Blog%201.jpg	<p>Marketing is full of the “shiny new thing” syndrome: companies wholeheartedly embracing the latest tech-enabled idea for driving eyeballs, clicks, and sales even before those new methods have been fully tested and proven to work better than alternatives.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We saw it with banner ads in the 2000s and the pivot to video in the 2010s and we’re in the middle of seeing it with the growing influencer economy of the 2020s.<br></p><p>Influencer marketing makes sense on paper, it’s true. People who have amassed huge followings by virtue of being either good-looking, funny, or useful (and very occasionally, two of those three) charge brands for access to said huge followings, and brands are happy to pay because they’re getting in front of an engaged, opted-in audience and they’re benefiting from the social proof inherent in the fact that the influencer is endorsing their product or service.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>But like with any marketing campaign, you’ve got to look at the costs and benefits. That’s hard to do in an area like influencer marketing where there’s not a lot of historical data to look at, and where even the mechanics—like Instagram’s algorithms—are constantly changing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here, we dig into:<br></p><ul><li>what influencer marketing is</li><li>how influencer marketing works</li><li>whether marketing through influencers is effective, and how to measure it</li><li>when a brand partnership might make more sense than an influencer</li><li>a checklist for choosing a good influencer to work with or brand partnership to pursue<br></li></ul><h2><strong>What is influencer marketing?</strong><br></h2><p>Influencer marketing is a strategy used by brands to promote their products and services. They hire someone with a large social media platform to endorse their products, share discounts and sales, and increase awareness of their brand.<br></p><p>The most popular platforms are Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, but that’s always changing; in 2016, Facebook took first place, per a <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Facebook-Instagram-Influencers-Favorite-Social-Platforms/1014349">SheSpeaks influencer report shared by eMarketer</a>, and TikTok had just launched.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s different from celebrity branding or product endorsement where public figures are paid to appear in advertising that’s clearly identifiable as advertising. In influencer marketing, those ads are woven into the regular content that a highly-engaged audience has come to expect from that public figure and aren’t immediately identifiable as marketing, and thus “influence” the audience more subtly.<br></p><p>For example, even though Drake appeared in State Farm’s Super Bowl ad this year—which State Farm proudly shared on their Instagram—he didn’t promote it on his. He was a paid spokesperson, not an influencer:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/605b7ad304d77d0e1fa3817a_ELhuLi9fpqdS6P7eNaDHiAlosimFczyb6hp95gPrjiUSZj2tYEv0Fh8r2mSfz6gLwlAYoencf6jIhAhore7XUEB_j2WWkbJkvI8KROooeXQ7h29GEgE7tId-E-NMYHf5W_wgs1wB.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/605b7ad2fa86caa1ca1bf82f_cQMY-d6_j_NgJVXNqUd55hLUbR0x5lCgDNK0n95inxiSFXY5eydBoZ66FYj0S9SJpW7M-chxMosK-QfEL5MmGqd2wBoJhcY0QwOCE6CGOeC8ShRk25QHOoTb3gq9fcTr7XVLATFy.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, influencer Oneika Raymond used to share mostly travel tips (and related products) with her 100k+ followers on Instagram.

Are they sharing a photo with a caption? A carousel of several photos? A video? A story, maybe with a swipe-up feature? A reel? A brand takeaway on your page? A link in their bio? A giveaway promoted across their entire page? And those are just the options on Instagram! Depending on the type of content, production budgets, and copyright preferences, a brand might have an influencer create all of the content to be shared, might set up them up a photoshoot or other resources to support the content, or might have the influencer share content produced entirely in-house.<br></p><h2><strong>Is influencer marketing effective?</strong><br></h2><p>You’d hope so, considering the expectation that the industry will hit $13.8 billion dollars that Influencer Marketing Hub found in their 2021 survey.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/605b7ad34651551db42b5411_PQreTEedi-U4LYKrhH17w1MGj5IXZkBG8PKsCODfAiDnmRBaOCuxBCCsfPYGGRPtCrbGfSpTFKgG38gljnCLEfTNEH-1jAQDgACIGF3L6mTCSv-vCA01oXE3QsfJEVqTowU2UIco.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>A lot of effectiveness depends on industry and specific goals, though, and per that report, only 67% of people who use influencer campaigns measure their ROI.<br></p><p>Goals for influencer marketing can include:<br></p><ul><li>Increasing brand awareness within a specific audience segment</li><li>Driving sales</li><li>Getting more leads</li><li>Creating user-generated content for future campaigns&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/605b7ad42edee64f35799013_Xn4FCvzufIG_6Mr3Wa4PZWdYSI5u1ePy2dSBx-0GpcgWHJteFDb3JIiYFzx1f8em2HTq7tdSDrgnY0f0hYpASmkZLaa1a7UcMLvrf4KjN2U059aWBBROJ5YjGX3zkjMuMdtgxBqa.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>This #sponsored Instagram post by a lifestyle blogger and influencer rights lawyer (!) includes a request for her audience to share their own pairings with a specific hashtag—which the liquor company can then use in subsequent social media posts.<br></p><p>Depending on the goals that a business selects, they might look at:<br></p><ul><li>Engagement: what percentage of an influencer’s audience engaged—liked, commented, shared, saved—with the campaign in some form?</li><li>Clicks: how many people followed a link shared by the influencer?</li><li>Views or impressions: how many followers saw the content?</li><li>Sales: how much revenue did a campaign bring in?</li><li>Followers: how many new followers did a campaign attract to the business page?<br></li></ul><p>All of those numbers need to be overlaid by spend, though, to be truly useful, like in the case of more traditional <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/three-ways-to-combat-rising-customer-acquisition-costs#:~:text=Your%20customer%20acquisition%20cost%20(CAC,That's%20extremely%20low!">customer acquisition costs</a>. How much did it cost to hire an influencer for a campaign, what were the results, and is that cheaper, more expensive, or the same as investing those marketing dollars into other avenues?&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are also risks to keep in mind. Influencer marketing can be ineffective and even damaging to a brand when it’s:<br></p><ul><li>With fraudulent influencers. Use tools like <a href="https://hypeauditor.com/en/">Hypeauditor</a> to verify an influencer’s audience is real and engaged.</li><li>With problematic influencers. If a brand works with an influencer in their niche who gets involved in a scandal or goes public with harmful personal views, the brand can suffer reputational damage.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2><strong>What’s the difference between influencers and brand partnerships?</strong><br></h2><p>Influencer marketing is based on accessing someone else’s engaged audience. But it’s not the only way to do that—brand partnerships are another.<br></p><p>Think of your favorite crossovers: LEGO x Star Wars.

How to Grow Average Order Value Post-Purchase	how-to-grow-average-order-value-post-purchase	How to Grow Average Order Value Post-Purchase	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fa2ba37b3c8fb611e3d58cf_How%20to%20Grow%20Average%20Order%20Value%20Post-Purchase.png	<p>If I asked you what the three most important metrics for any eCommerce retailer to keep an eye on are, what would you respond?&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s a subjective question, and I’d be happy to get into a spirited debate about the merits of net promoter score vs. customer acquisition. But there’s one key metric that reigns supreme, no matter your niche, size, or sales strategy: your average order value (AOV).<br></p><p>And while most advice for increasing AOV is centered on things you can do before your customers check out, that’s a bit obvious. Taking a more zoomed-out approach and focusing on post-purchase opportunities can provide major benefits to you, your customers, and your metrics.<br></p><p>Here’s what we’ll cover in this article:<br></p><ul><li>What is AOV and how is it measured?</li><li>Why does AOV matter?</li><li>Three ways to grow average order value post-purchase</li></ul><ul><li>Upselling: letting customers know about relevant add-on and complementary products after checkout</li><li>Purchase reminders: encouraging customers to upgrade themselves or their gift recipients on a regular basis&nbsp;</li><li>Extended warranties: helping customers protect their products while driving up AOV&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li></ul><h2><strong>What is AOV and how is it measured?</strong><br></h2><p>Average order value is exactly what it sounds like—it’s the average amount a customer spends per order. It’s different from customer lifetime value, which is a function of their <strong>spend</strong> x <strong>the length of time</strong> that they are a customer.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Across industries, AOV is going up. Last year’s IR500 report found that the median AOV for online retailers went up from $130 to $150, suggesting that customers are spending more each time they check out. That trend is particularly strong with housewares, home furnishings, jewelry, and electronics:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fa171587243263e26b30511_3XEkIJw9AOCUylro3KEiIOO6BqlHz4hFONFCEgXR-AbHppIzh8NnAwtimynpz-s-POYLt0OZ-bY_tSr2Ucmf5zg0OuAd8P09l26BnHarnYNlt10haW7EG4YX-US1ImxvNa8cLRsN.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption>Source: Digital Commerce 360, Internet Retailer 500, 2019</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><h2><strong>Why does AOV matter?</strong><br></h2><p>Knowing your AOV tells you a lot about your customer: what they usually purchase, when they’re willing to spend more than that amount and why, and what price points they feel most comfortable with.<br></p><p>There’s no one right place your AOV should be, but like with most sales metrics, more is always better. Having a higher AOV means higher revenue even if customers don’t become lifelong converts. (Ideally, they would, but that’s a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/10-ways-for-retailers-to-improve-customer-lifetime-value-ltv-clv">focus for a different article</a>.)<br></p><h3><strong>How to grow average order value post-purchase</strong><br></h3><p>Focusing on increasing AOV only before your customer has placed an order can feel risky. What if you scare them away with too many add-on options or product bundles?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Spread out your AOV-enhancing marketing strategies throughout the whole process for a low-risk, high-reward approach.<br></p><h3><strong>1. Upselling</strong><br></h3><p>Skillful upselling works for you because it means extra revenue and it works for your customers because it lets you build a partnership with them and fulfill their needs over time. But note the “skillful”: this is targeted, relevant post-purchase offers, not bombarding a buyer with a million and one products as soon as they’ve gotten their order confirmation.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Etsy does this well; in their post-purchase confirmation email, at the very bottom, they include a few “related items” to add on to your order:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fa171578d16aabe3cb02436_SUMu_eGKXuur4hNCv5yT1jgyRS4kPCI-Bn9gFeoXDJSSYZFuqrzoX_FDQc28PAkdhtABslj_efN9J7WWcD4ZzVSCU1vIS5KJfx8NdpkZHnidzDrdzr85GeipqWEfiV_Y3oIq-3fl.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>If I’ve just bought a photo of a Boston skyline from this retailer, I might be tempted to get another iconic shot from them, particularly since their way of showing me this option was so unintrusive.<br></p><h3><strong>2. Purchase reminders</strong><br></h3><p>What kind of regular buying cycle are most of your customers on? Depending on your product niche, you might be able to predict exactly when your customers are most likely to be interested in future purchases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, If someone bought a bouquet for you this Mother’s Day, chances they’ll need another one next year. Same goes for consumer goods, clothing, and food—all of that needs to be constantly replenished.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Use reminders as a chance to grow AOV by suggesting product upgrades, especially for gift purchases, since <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017018">research shows</a> that spending money on people to whom we have strong social ties makes us happier than spending money on ourselves.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Check out this reminder to buy birthday flowers. It suggests buying a deluxe bouquet—more expensive than the original purchase—as a last-minute birthday gift:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fa1715756b915e146a33c9d_lu7ysYpV4-PK8cn5LtxQqGx8kqP5VxJIczGvedsr-W5zbcTUHz_jEAKkKiNx0n8X3AK8fweB75Fe22tfpWlxzAdEvibkyP42PUHACoCRV_ad2ZXah5TF3AZLbexIyWt-GUlSds1R.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h3><strong>3. Extended warranties</strong><br></h3><p>Offering warranties post-purchase does two things: first, it makes customers feel secure in knowing that their recent purchase will be covered and that they have a partner to help them out if anything happens, and second, it drives AOV with high-margin products that sellers don’t even have to administer themselves.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For instance, Chili Sleep saw an 11% increase in AOV after they offered product protection through Clyde after checkout:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fa171577bb8d049f9f45157_WWWoktq_mkfPErAbX3gM49tBb4PagBQv6h7MBAqhZ6g7WoPEJx6zSW8X8Lv6bR0-xJSZ6pJroA5Dxo8UvZAx0x1g0hQh2sVTH0gwcPQmK1Mb78eA0oEmQ4ieDqNwkIYRpTd0bn2d.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><h2><strong>Growing average order value post-purchase is well within reach</strong><br></h2><p>Offering relevant upsells, helpful product purchase reminders, and peace-of-mind-granting product protection can all help drive up average order value over time. If your ecommerce business hasn’t already invested in post-purchase communication, you should—it’s a great way to build a relationship with your customers over time, driving up not just AOVs but also customer satisfaction and purchase frequency. Pretty sure we don’t need a debate to agree on that being good for everyone!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	Wed Nov 04 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
How To Manage Warranties With Magento	how-to-manage-warranties-with-magento	How To Manage Warranties With Magento	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/609a90e55b65afc327e28f92_Magneto%20Warranty%20Blog%20Artwork%203.jpg	<p><br></p><p>If you’re a Magento store owner, you care about conversions.<br></p><p>Maybe you’re Nine West, <a href="https://www.beargroup.com/ideas/what-companies-use-magento">using</a> the programmer-friendly e-commerce platform to connect with shoe lovers looking to fill their online carts.<br></p><p>Perhaps you’re Beecher’s Handmade Cheese, a beloved indie retailer using Magento to highlight content like recipes along with shopping opportunities.<br></p><p>But whether you’re a major enterprise or a smaller retailer, you rely on Magento to keep your customers informed on your products and to help shoppers convert into buyers.<br></p><p>What do you do after that, though? How can you convert a one-time shopper into a loyal customer? What about convincing those would-be shoppers who are worried about the longevity of a product? How can you give them peace of mind that they’ll be taken care of if something goes wrong?<br></p><p>That’s where warranties come in. We’ve seen how retailers who offer <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/protection-plan-coverage">extended warranties</a> on their products can <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/merchant-dashboard-features">increase average order value</a>, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/customer-loyalty">increase customer loyalty</a>, and increase conversions. It doesn’t matter if you sell jewelry, mattresses, coffeemakers, or anything in between—you and your customers both win with a solid warranty partner on board.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here, we walk you through how to decide on warranty management options for your Magento store (and where Clyde fits in).<br></p><h3><strong>What To Look for in Magento Warranty Management Software</strong></h3><p>Since Magento generally isn’t as plug-and-play as other eCommerce platforms like Shopify or BigCommerce, you’re probably used to investing some hands-on-keys developer time when it comes to integrating add-ons.<br></p><p>Still, you want to minimize the amount of work that your team will have to do to get your warranty management software of choice and up and running. Same goes for the amount of intervention your sales, marketing, and customer service teams will have to do in the future.<br></p><p>To find the right software for your team, look for these features before choosing a warranty partner for your Magento store:<br></p><h4><strong>Flexibility in product coverage</strong></h4><p>You want to make sure that you’re choosing a partner who can cover all of the products you sell. Some warranty partners work with a single insurance focused on a niche market, like computers or furniture. If you sell a wide range of products, make sure that you’re covered for all of them.<br></p><h4><strong>Automated operational tasks</strong></h4><p>Once you’ve downloaded and integrated the software, will it run on your Magento site pretty much independently? Make sure you understand the operational tasks that you’ll be expected to do to run your warranty program, if any exist.<br></p><h4><strong>Customization options</strong></h4><p>You’ll want your warranty software to integrate seamlessly into your current purchasing process. Look for software that allows for the creation of unique call-to-actions that can be co-branded with your company, allowing you to add your logo, color scheme, font, and brand voice to the check-out process.<br></p><h4><strong>Multiple CTAs</strong></h4><p>To sell warranties, you’ll use CTAs that prompt buyers to add a warranty to their purchase. Ideally, your chosen warranty partner will give you several options for integrating those CTAs into the purchase process, and you’ll also be able to select how you present extended warranty options (from a single link to a comprehensive list) and to experiment with different presentations.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Pricing adjustments to drive revenue</strong></h4><p>Do you want to decide exactly how much to charge for your warranty? The software you choose should let you. A bonus is software that uses historical data to auto-manage the margins you’ll earn on warranty sales to optimize revenue.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Multiple users with custom permissions</strong></h4><p>Who will be managing your warranty plan? If you’ve got more than one person who will want to stay up close and personal to how your extended warranty program is performing, make sure the software you choose lets you add and manage multiple team members.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Regular reporting and analytics</strong></h4><p>You don’t want to have to dig for information on the warranties you’re selling. Look for software partners that offer clear, customizable analytics dashboards where you can keep an eye on things like contracts sold, product value covered, contract revenue earned, and your profit.<br></p><h4><strong>A responsive support team</strong></h4><p>Hopefully nothing goes wrong as you bring on an extended warranty partner, but in the case that onboarding isn’t quite as simple as you’d hoped or you have questions about implementation, you’ll want to make sure you can get real support from a knowledgeable source. Check out the customer service options available from each provider before making your choice, and if they only offer chat or email help, make sure you’re comfortable with that option.<br></p><h4><strong>An easy-to-use customer portal</strong></h4><p>Keep in mind that your customers may be reaching out for support, too, as they submit claims. Do you feel comfortable with your chosen provider representing your brand? Is there an easy way for customers to get help?<br></p><h4><strong>Magento Warranty Management Providers</strong></h4><p>With a long list of things to look for in a Magento warranty management provider, you’ll want to do your research before deciding.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that most warranty management providers have their own niche. They may be focused on enterprise clients. Or on niche eCommerce vendors. Perhaps they’ve got great offerings for certain products, but not for everything you offer. (Or maybe they can cover everything, but you’ll have to match your products’ eligibility to a network of their insurer partners.)&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://marketplace.magento.com/clyde-module-warranty.html">Clyde’s Magento module</a> works with retailers of all sizes and across all industries, with warranty program solutions for everyone. We offer a portfolio of insurance partners to offer protection on a huge range of products, and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection">we can cover everything</a> from warranty extensions to wear and tear to water damage and accidents.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Benefits of Using Warranty Management for Magento</strong></h4><p>There are benefits of using warranty management software for your Magento store for both merchants and their consumers.</p><h4><strong>Passive revenue</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>Retailers can add to their average order values and their profit margins without having to shell out to create new products or a different service model. A good warranty program partner will manage everything from the customer’s side, leaving merchants to sit back and watch the revenue roll in.</p><h4><strong>Strengthened relationship with consumers</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>Offering an extended warranty plan to your customers is like offering them peace of mind. They’ll feel supported and confident in their purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><h4><strong>Regular touchpoints</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>And as a retailer offering extended warranties, you’re guaranteeing yourself a regular (and customer-appreciated) <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">touchpoint</a> to engage with them down the line, whether at a one, two, or three year mark when their extended warranty is up, to reconnect and drive future sales.</p><h3><strong>How to Configure Clyde’s Warranty Management App</strong></h3><h4><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h4><p><strong>‍</strong>Developers who want to be able to integrate and troubleshoot the Clyde Magento plugin should be experienced with:</p><ul><li>PHP</li><li>Magento 2</li><li>jQuery</li><li>RequireJS</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Developer Toolbar (Available in browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Brave)</li><li>Xdebug</li></ul><h4><strong>Installation</strong></h4><p>Clyde Warranty plugin can be installed using either FTP/SSH or Composer.</p><p>Once installed you’ll need to obtain login credentials by submitting a<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect"> connection request</a> or by reaching out to sales@joinclyde.com. You’ll be able to create additional accounts for your team in the Settings page of your dashboard or by contacting your customer success manager.</p><h4><strong>To install using FTS/SSH, you’ll:</strong></h4><ol><li>Unpack the extension ZIP file on your computer.</li><li>Connect to your website source folder with FTP/SFTP/SSH client and upload all the files and folders from the extension package to the “app/code” folder of your Magento installation.<br>Please use the “Merge” upload mode.

The software you choose should let you. A bonus is software that uses historical data to auto-manage the margins you’ll earn on warranty sales to optimize revenue.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Multiple users with custom permissions</strong></h3><p>Who will be managing your warranty plan? If you’ve got more than one person who will want to stay up close and personal to how your extended warranty program is performing, make sure the software you choose lets you add and manage multiple team members.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Regular reporting and analytics</strong></h3><p>You don’t want to have to dig for information on the warranties you’re selling. Look for software partners that offer clear, customizable analytics dashboards where you can keep an eye on things like contracts sold, product value covered, contract revenue earned, and your profit.<br></p><h3><strong>A responsive support team</strong></h3><p>Hopefully nothing goes wrong as you bring on an extended warranty partner, but in the case that onboarding isn’t quite as simple as you’d hoped or you have questions about implementation, you’ll want to make sure you can get real support from a knowledgeable source. Check out the customer service options available from each provider before making your choice, and if they only offer chat or email help, make sure you’re comfortable with that option.<br></p><h3><strong>An easy-to-use customer portal</strong></h3><p>Keep in mind that your customers may be reaching out for support, too, as they submit claims. Do you feel comfortable with your chosen provider representing your brand? Is there an easy way for customers to get help?<br></p><h2><strong>Shopify Warranty Management Providers</strong></h2><p>With a long list of things to look for in a Shopify warranty management provider, you’ll want to do your research before deciding.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that most warranty management providers have their own niche. They may be focused on enterprise clients. Or on niche eCommerce vendors. Perhaps they’ve got great offerings for certain products, but not for everything you offer. (Or maybe they can cover everything, but you’ll have to match your products’ eligibility to a network of their insurer partners.)&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://apps.shopify.com/clyde-warranty-platform">Clyde’s Shopify app</a> works with retailers of all sizes and across all industries, with warranty program solutions for everyone. We offer a portfolio of insurance partners to offer protection on a huge range of products, and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection">we can cover everything</a> from warranty extensions to wear and tear to water damage and accidents.&nbsp;</p><p>It takes about two minutes to get Clyde up and running on a Shopify store, whether you’re an enterprise retailer or a smaller seller.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of Using Warranty Management for Shopify</strong></h2><p>There are benefits of using warranty management software for Shopify stores for both merchants and their consumers.</p><h3><strong>Passive revenue</strong></h3><p><strong>‍<br></strong>Retailers can add to their average order values and their profit margins without having to shell out to create new products or a different service model. A good warranty program partner will manage everything from the customer’s side, leaving merchants to sit back and watch the revenue roll in.</p><h3><strong>Strengthened relationship with consumers</strong></h3><p><strong>‍<br></strong>Offering an extended warranty plan to your customers is like offering them peace of mind. They’ll feel supported and confident in their purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Regular touchpoints</strong></h3><p><strong>‍<br></strong>And as a retailer offering extended warranties, you’re guaranteeing yourself a regular (and customer-appreciated) <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">touchpoint</a> to engage with them down the line, whether at a one, two, or three year mark when their extended warranty is up, to reconnect and drive future sales.</p><h2><strong>How to Configure Clyde’s Warranty Management App for Shopify</strong></h2><p>Getting started with <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/clyde-warranty-platform">Clyde’s Shopify app</a> is easy!

How to Talk to Your Customers About Product Protection	how-to-talk-to-your-customers-about-product-protection	How to Talk to Your Customers About Product Protection	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5efa4d6f0f473163fa09e09e_200302_Talking_2%20(1).jpg	<p>Product protection is good for everyone. It’s good for the buyer of your couch or kitchen appliance or phone or dog-walking robot (does this exist? If not, we’re calling dibs) or other product, who doesn’t have to worry about something going wrong. And it’s good for the seller, especially if you<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect"> offer it through Clyde</a> and can benefit from building expanded customer trust in your offerings and shoring up your commitment to excellent customer service, all without having to invest your own time into running a high-quality claims process.</p><p>Talking to your customers about product protection doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s what we suggest.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is product protection?</h3><p>First off, let’s make sure we’re all on the same page with what we’re talking about. Product protection is sometimes called an extended warranty, because it goes beyond a manufacturer’s—or limited— warranty (which typically provides repair or replacement services for one year) and gives consumers the option to invest in a service contract that will cover them for longer periods of time, and often includes accident protection. Learn more about the ins and outs of warranties and product protection<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection"> here</a>.</p><p>Offering product protection doesn’t mean that you’re telling consumers you think the product you’re selling will break on them. It means that you’re reassuring them that if it does—or if life gets in the way with accidents and issues—they’ll be covered.</p><p>AppleCare, for example, is a form of product protection. If you were buying a new iPhone and wanted to make sure you were covered if you dropped it, had a software issue, or had it stolen, buying an AppleCare plan would give you that peace of mind. If and when you had an issue, they’d take care of it for you.</p><h3>What do customers currently understand about product protection?</h3><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/46/1/36/5042225?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Research shows</a> that when we imagine customers’ lived experiences, we come up with more creative, original, and functional ideas to serve them or connect with them; that<a href="https://www.ama.org/marketing-news/how-does-empathetic-marketing-make-you-feel/"> holds true for marketing</a>, too.</p><p>So to talk to customers about the value of product protection, you need to start by imagining their point of view.</p><p>When it comes to extended warranties and product protection, customers generally understand them as ways to get “peace of mind and freedom from financial outlays if their purchase needs repairs,” per<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969698906000634?via%3Dihub"> research done by Towson University</a>. That means that to connect with customers, you need to lead with a message about the ease of navigating repair or replacement with an extended warranty. Clyde makes that easy by providing your customers with a claims process that takes less than one minute to process, auto-resolutions for most situations, and easy-to-understand contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since many customers’ understanding of product protection is centered around breaks or repairs, they may not realize that product protection can cover replacement, too, including in the case of an accident. It may be worth highlighting the protection options your company offers and all the ways in which it could come in handy.</p><p>Other<a href="http://english.ckgsb.edu.cn/sites/default/files/ck_faculty_bhsun_esc.pdf"> research done by the University of Maryland, Rice University, and Carnegie Mellon University</a> found that customers are more likely to buy extended warranties when they feel like the purchase is one that’s fun or hedonistic versus utilitarian. Make sure you frame your product as one that will make their life more enjoyable.</p><p>Let’s go back to the iPhone example. Even though a phone is pretty much the most utilitarian tool on the planet—you need it to check emails, make calls, and get work done—all of Apple’s marketing is centered around showcasing the iPhone as a hub of creativity and leisure. When’s the last time you saw a spreadsheet app as part of an iPhone ad? Never, because those ads focus on more enjoyable parts of life: listening to music, playing games, shooting short films, and connecting with friends and family.</p><h3>Use on communication best practices to highlight why product protection works</h3><p>Even though talking to customers about product production is good for both customers, who get greater peace of mind upon purchase, and for sellers, with the better sales results it can bring, having that conversation isn’t always easy. The terminology around warranties can get complicated.</p><p>Leaning on psychological research that explains ways of thinking can help you connect with your customers with messages that meet their mark. For instance, try using:</p><ul><li>The<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#authority"> consensus effect</a>, where you can share information on how many people buy product protection to make customers feel part of a community</li><li>The<a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814417358_0006"> loss aversion effect</a>, where you can highlight what having product protection actually protects customers from, like losing the money they spent on the product if something goes wrong or they break it</li><li>The<a href="https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/#authority"> authority bias</a>, where you can highlight that informed, savvy, and educated shoppers tend to be the ones most likely to buy protection plans, as explained in<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/lp/educated-consumers-spend-more"> this white paper</a></li></ul><p>Even if that research influences your communication strategy, make sure the language you use in that communication is honest and clear.</p><p>Don’t bog readers down with complicated legalese or overly sales-y messaging. Use a clear, friendly tone.</p><p>Keep your writing skimmable with shorter sentences, spacing between paragraphs, and headings and subheadings that break up the text.</p><p>Use examples to answer common customer questions. Show them what it would actually look like to file a claim, for instance, or share case studies of customer claims successfully processed.</p><h3>Overall, remember to meet your customers where they are</h3><p>Product protection doesn’t have to be complicated. When talking to your customers about their options, be straightforward and clear. Explain what limited or manufacturer warranties cover and how extended warranty or accident protection plans can fill in the gaps. Give them all the information they need to make the decision that’s right for them.</p><p>Don’t be too pushy and don’t bog down their purchase journey with extra screens and forms to fill out. Instead, use a provider that integrates automatically, like Clyde, and<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect"> let us take it from there</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	Mon Jun 29 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
How Warranty Claims Management Is Becoming More Customer-Centric	how-warranty-claims-management-is-becoming-more-customer-centric	How Warranty Claims Management Is Becoming More Customer-Centric	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f996d1f5d6f1c5f60b455e7_How%20Warranty%20Claims%20Management%20Is%20Becoming%20More%20Customer-Centric.png	<p>Product warranties are meant to give customers peace of mind so that they can confidently use the things they love. If something goes wrong, they have backup. A fix or a replacement.<br></p><p>But that peace of mind disappears the instant the process of filing a claim gets complicated.<br></p><p>Common customer pain points during the claims process include:<br></p><ul><li>Manual and repetitive data collection processes</li><li>Slow approval processes</li><li>Lack of transparency as to next steps<br></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Clyde is pushing to change</a> that by redesigning the warranty claims management process to be more customer-centric. Here’s how:<br></p><ul><li>Automatic enrollment in claims management system upon purchase, keeping all purchase information in one place</li><li>Quicker, automatic approval process, with most claims resolved the same day</li><li>Transparency throughout, from what’s covered by the warranty to proactive notifications as a claim is processed<br></li></ul><h2><strong>A look at an average warranty claims process</strong>‍</h2><p>Here’s an example of standard claims walkthrough from a major educational tech company:<br><br></p><ul><li>Customer must find their original receipt with their order number and locate the serial number on their device</li><li>They call a help hotline that’s open from 9 a.m. to midnight</li><li>If their issue is covered by their policy, as decided on by the agent who answers the phone, they’ll get an email that provides them the return order number for the item</li><li>They’ll get another email with a shipping label and ship the item in</li><li>They’ll wait to find out if they’re getting a repair, a refund, or if their claim is denied<br></li></ul><p>Things might work out fine for the customer seeking help—or they might not. It’s hard to have confidence that things will go smoothly because no part of that process is optimized for the customer. Not the need for them to dig up paperwork, or to call at a certain time, or to wait days or even weeks to find out if their claim is actually going to be approved in the end.<br></p><p>But that’s changing.<br></p><p>Retailers are starting to realize that customers truly care about product protection, with 24% of customers choosing where they shop based on where product protection is available and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/research/customer-expectations/">62% of customers</a> actively sharing negative experiences.<br></p><p>As a result, they’re looking for product protection partners like Clyde, who can offer better customer experiences across the board.<br></p><h3><strong>Improvement 1: Automated Enrollment</strong><br></h3><p>There are no extra steps when it comes to activating a Clyde protection plan. Customers log into our portal with their email address, which automatically pulls all of their product and contract info. No receipts or serial numbers needed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When they file a claim, their information is automatically imported and they just have to answer a few quick questions to finish it off.</p><h3>‍<strong>Improvement 2: Faster Approvals</strong><br></h3><p>Customers with product protection through Clyde don’t need to wait long for resolution on their issues. We automatically review claims and provide an approval, and in many cases, a resolution, on the spot. Most claims are resolved the same day. Our platform also supports super seamless repairs facilitated by the retailer.<br></p><h3><strong>Improvement 3: More Transparency Along the Way</strong><br></h3><p>From the beginning, Clyde sets out to make things as simple and transparent as possible by using plain language to describe coverage in our plans so that customers know exactly what is and isn’t included. When an issue comes up that’s covered by the retailer’s warranty versus Clyde’s, we provide a direct handoff of the issue from our portal to the retailer’s support team to keep things seamless for the customer.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And all along the way, no matter the kind of issue or whether it’s Clyde or the retailer fixing it, we keep the customer in the loop, with notifications and real-time transparency on the claim approval process.<br></p><h2><strong>Overall, warranty claims management is becoming more customer-centric—and that’s a good thing for everyone.</strong><br></h2><p>These three trends in making claims management more customer-centric are all focused on the individual claims process—there’s a lot to improve there, and we’re proud of the changes Clyde is driving.<br></p><p>But we’re taking things a step further, too.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Clyde isn’t just helping to resolve problems that come up. We’re also enabling retailers to stop problems from happening in the first place. By providing sellers detailed analytics dashboards that identify patterns in warranty claims, we can help them to solve recurring product issues. Knowing exactly what’s going wrong and how the customer claim process is going lets retailers give focused attention to making product and process improvements. And that’s when everyone—customer, retailer, and claims management partner—wins.</p><p><br></p>	Wed Oct 28 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

Increasing Your Store’s Margin and Average Order Value	increasing-margin-and-aov	Increasing Your Store’s Margin and Average Order Value	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc799cc425fa91cab78471d_Blog_dollar%20bill.2.png	<p><strong>Article Highlights</strong></p><ul><li>Define Average Order Value</li><li>Define Gross Margin Rate</li><li>Identify strategy to address Average Order Value and Gross Margin Rate</li><li>Identify tactics to build on</li></ul><p>Growing past baseline profit as a merchant has traditionally meant balancing price and consumer tolerance. But rising market confidence has the retail industry set to top <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-retail-outlook/us-retail-sales-expected-to-top-38-trillion-in-2019-nrf-idUSKCN1PU1YM" data-rt-link-type="external">$3.8 trillion in 2019</a>. It is time for retailers to rethink how they make financial gains. Getting back to the basics, starting with average order value and gross margin, can do exactly that. </p><p>AOV is often held above other key performance indicators because it provides a benchmark for in-store and ecommerce growth. But, when it comes to bottom-line potential, finding the right tool for the job that really matters, matters most. And AOV is one step removed from gauging a business’s real capacity to grow. Gross margin is not. Learning to drive margin forward while holding strong AOV may be the winning combination that unlocks growth.<br></p><p>Before discovering strategies to expand margin and AOV, we need to understand what these two values mean and how we can affect them. </p><h2>The Numbers Part</h2><h3>How to Calculate Average Order Value<br></h3><p>Average order value is the typical dollar amount spent per customer when an order is placed. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc7343c77b60b4346f1a8b6_AOV.png"></div><figcaption>Average Order Value</figcaption></figure><p>To find the AOV, first calculate the total group sales revenue by taking the sum of the total revenue in a given period of time (such as months, quarters or years) and then calculate the total number of purchases within that same period of time. Divide the total revenue by the total number of purchases. <br></p><p>While this value is commonly used across all orders, it may also be useful to measure AOV by product category. Combining and recombining the variables of category and time can give precise insights into how business is growing. </p><h3>How to Calculate Gross Margin and Gross Margin Rate</h3><p>Gross margin is the amount of money retailers make from a sale after they have paid for the cost of goods sold. Gross margin is calculated as sales revenue minus the product cost. This sum will give the dollar amount earned in each sale. That sum is also the first step toward grasping the relationship between AOV, Gross Margin, and Gross Margin Rate which will later be viewed as a percentage of sales revenue. But, for now:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc734d3e0272b7505c781ba_Gross%20Margin.png"></div><figcaption>Gross Margin</figcaption></figure><p>Sales revenue and product cost can be taken as individual numbers to find the margin on an individual item, or from larger groups like product category or total sales. To compare the typical gross of an average sale to the typical margin gained from that sale, we'll need to find the Average Gross Margin, i.e., the average of a group of sales. A group can be anything from all-sales to a specific category or type of product. Note, the group and time period must remain the same when calculating both the sales revenue and product cost.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc73524e0272b9475c796fa_Average%20Gross%20Margin.png"></div><figcaption>Average Gross Margin<br></figcaption></figure><p>Now we have the average gross margin as a dollar value. To make that number proportional, to an entire category, we’ll need to represent those dollar amounts as a percentage of a chosen group’s total sales revenue. To find this value we divide the group’s average gross margin by its average sales revenue. </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc7356d1cada0662be04810_Avg.%20Gross%20Margin%20Rate.png"></div><figcaption>Average Gross Margin Rate<br></figcaption></figure><p>Now with a firm grasp of how the values within gross margin relate to each other, it is easier to see how to improve that number. </p><p>Similar to AOV, both Gross Margin and Gross Margin Rate are dependent on sales revenue. Finding ways to increase total sales revenue is the key to increasing both AOV and gross margin. The trick to growth will be in making those changes while maintaining existing product costs.</p><h2>The Strategy Part</h2><h3>Consumer Behavior Trends <br></h3><p>The most straightforward way to increase total sales revenue without increasing product cost is to increase the selling price. But this practice neglects the customer. Not to mention, the retail market is rife with price competition that traditionally behaves like dueling jet pilots mid dogfight - rolling and nose-diving to stay alive. So, increasing price without adding value is also the most straightforward way to lose customers and decrease profit. </p><p>In an industry where titans like Amazon have stalled margin at 2% since 2010, what works?</p><p>Leading trends show retail shoppers are gravitating toward seamless experience, customer service and trustworthy business practices. Consumers are not only tolerant of added costs for these benefits, they are actively seeking those trade offs. <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2018/experience-is-everything-heres-how-to-get-it-right.html" data-rt-link-type="external">A study by PWC</a> shows customers will pay 16% more for better customer experience. </p><h3>Building Trust Rises All Ships</h3><p>According to a <a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/06/1646241/0/en/SurveyMonkey-Reveals-New-Research-to-Help-Businesses-Understand-Consumer-Perceptions-on-Trust.html" data-rt-link-type="external">2018 survey</a>, brand trust plays a role for 92% of Americans when considering a purchase. Building trust can be broken down into 3 key points:</p><ul><li>Product Transparency </li><li>Data Transparency</li><li>Explanation of Benefits</li></ul><p>Solving questions around data transparency may be beyond the scope a mere blog post. However, product transparency and explanation of benefits can both be addressed by product warranties. Warranties work by level setting customer expectations of the product and the benefits of making a purchase. In the case of Clyde, warranties are delivered with a unique identifying customer code and a guide that details the benefits of their coverage. </p><p>Retailers can offer warranties outside of the manufacturer’s warranty, known as protection plans. Protection plans give businesses a couple operational benefits that help increase total sales revenue without affecting product cost. </p><ul><li>Plans are paid for by the consumer as a form of insurance. With additional product cost moved from the seller to the customer, the seller is able to take a more consultative approach. </li><li>With a partner platform like Clyde, there are no startup costs. </li></ul><p>The result of a successful warranty program is clear - outright growth in sales revenue without increased cost. Building consumer trust in your retail brand can be a long, multi-step process. Offering protection plans offers businesses a head start against their competition, while providing opportunity for sales revenue growth. </p><h3>What Retailers Can Expect</h3><p>By providing a protection plan, businesses are able to increase consumer trust in their brand while increasing potential sales revenue. Increased sales revenue will raise those ships that depend on it. An AOV including product protection will look like: </p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc736a82e0e2b82fc88714b_AOV%20Rate%20%2B.png"></div></figure><p>An Average Gross Margin Rate including product protection will look like:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc736be1cada0d647e098b3_Avg%20Gross%20Margin%20Rate%20%2B.png"></div></figure><p>Product protection has been around since before the Staples easy button. But, recent digital solutions are expanding this avenue of growth from big-box, in-store, retailers to the broader retail and e-tail communities. That shift has come just in time to meet growing expectations for trust and service options. <br></p>	Fri Apr 26 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jericho-shackelford
Introducing Clyde	introducing-clyde	Introducing Clyde	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e57570d87a24c1065e5f_bench-accounting-49025-unsplash.jpg	<h2><strong>Our Vision</strong></h2><p>Clyde is on a mission to transform insurance at the point of sale, starting with the extended warranty market. Our technology is increasing consumers’ access to extended warranties by connecting insurance companies with retailers that have long been out of reach to do business with.</p><p>While the extended warranty market is neither new nor small, it has been until now, fairly exclusive. The US market for extended warranties is $40 billion annually. However, due to the various obstacles involved in working with insurance companies, only the biggest retailers have been able to take advantage of this market. Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and a small handful of others make billions each year selling extended warranties.</p><p>Clyde isn’t trying to take on these retail behemoths – at least not at first. Rather, our aim is to <em>expand</em>the market for extended warranties by making it possible for retailers of <em>all</em> sizes to offer their customers product protection and profit from these transactions.</p><h3><strong>Why Clyde?</strong></h3><p>With Clyde, everyone wins.</p><ul><li>Insurers gain access to new business with millions of products from thousands of retailers now within their reach by making only <em>one</em>integration – with Clyde.</li><li>Retailers profit from the sale of each warranty and can increase the scope of their customer service offering at no cost.</li><li>Shoppers can get the best protection for their purchases from thousands of retailers.</li></ul><h3><strong>How Clyde Works</strong></h3><p>Clyde provides a better experience for all stakeholders. Businesses can integrate our app with their ecommerce platform, customize their call to action, select a few preferences, connect a bank account, and launch in just a few minutes. If retailers engage the autopilot feature, our software will combine insights from our partners with our own analytics to maximize conversions and revenue. In addition, purchasing an extended warranty takes only a couple clicks right on the retailer’s website, and Clyde’s insurance marketplace guarantees that customers get the best protection for their specific product. Clyde makes offering extended warranties an entirely passive part of a retailer’s business.</p>	Thu Jul 19 2018 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	brandon-gell
John Caplan Joins Clyde's Board Of Directors	john-caplan-joins-clydes-board-of-directors	John Caplan Joins Clyde's Board Of Directors	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ff8762a0c25313351a9ae4d_Option%20One.png	<p>Clyde has big plans in store for 2021, and to kick things off we're proud to announce the appointment of John Caplan to our board of directors.</p><p>Caplan, the current President of Alibaba North America &amp; Europe, brings over two decades worth of executive experience to the Clyde team. Caplan served as the President of About.com from 1998 through 2001, before accepting the role of CEO at Ford Models, Inc. in 2002. During his tenure with Ford Models, Caplan grew sales and revenue figures by 5x before a successful sale to Stone Tower Equity Partners in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2009, Caplan founded the company OpenSky, a social shopping marketplace that helped people discover, buy and share unique goods that matched their individual taste. OpenSky was later acquired by Alibaba Group in 2017, a successful startup exit that also included Caplan’s appointment as the President of Alibaba North America &amp; Europe. He currently leads Alibaba’s growth and globalization initiatives in the company’s pursuit of becoming the singular operating system for global trade.</p><p>“We are thrilled to add John Caplan to the Clyde family, not only as a board member but also as an invaluable mentor to our business,” said Clyde CEO, Brandon Gell. “John’s track record as both a leader and entrepreneur in the eCommerce space makes him an ideal thought partner as we scale our business in 2021.”</p><p>“I love working with companies that are passionate about solving problems,” said Caplan. “It’s clear to me that Clyde and its growing team are determined to streamline the product ownership experience for companies and customers while generating substantial value for everyone involved. It’s an exciting time to be joining this company and its thriving culture.”&nbsp;</p><p>We sat down with John over the holidays to discuss what drew him to Clyde and why he’s so excited for what lies ahead.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What drew you to Clyde?</strong></h3><p>It starts at the top and when I met Brandon, I was struck by just how brilliant and thoughtful he was. And then there was the opportunity angle. When you think about an industry like the warranty space, these are the kinds of industries where business has been done one way for seemingly a hundred years. So to change that, you need some who deeply understands how the industry works, but also someone who possesses the vision to imagine a better and more interesting approach to the business. Brandon and his team possess that rare combination.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>How can you impact Clyde right away?</strong></h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ffc64360b1f3fba6b994aad_5f299e3039ec991c99cc1a12_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-24%20at%2011.35.51%20AM.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>As an independent board member, I view myself as an advocate for customers, for the team, and for the shareholders. From a customer perspective, I want to be an advocate for a streamlined and straightforward warranty experience, because online sales are exploding. In the matter of a few years, we’ve gone from 10 percent of all sales being done online to 20 percent, and China is outpacing that considerably with numbers approaching 40 percent. That’s where we’re headed, and we need intuitive and ease-to-use warranty programs to support that growth. So in a way, I’m advocating for that customer need.</p><p>From a Clyde team perspective, you want to grow and evolve quickly in a rapidly changing eCommerce landscape. My experience with Alibaba grounds my view on what’s possible. Three years ago Alibaba was essentially a yellow page directory of factories largely based in China. In 2020, Alibaba did $24 billion in transactions, because we changed the product to meet the needs of buyers and sellers. In a similar way, Clyde helps merchants create more value for their customers without them having to do a lot more work or spend more money.<br></p><h3><strong>What is the core opportunity for product warranty providers like Clyde in 2021?</strong></h3><p>As an outsider, it appeared to me that the online warranty space was undefined, opaque and in a lot of ways confusing to customers. “What do I need to do to redeem my warranty?” When people don’t have a direct answer to that question, it’s easy for them to lay blame at the feet of companies and subsequently their insurance and technology providers. That’s the problem right now, but that sets up the solution and opportunity for Clyde. By communicating clearly and creating a top-notch experience that is simple and easy to use, you can pave over that mistrust and frustration very quickly. In the end, this goes back to empathizing with the customer and identifying their pain points.

livestream shopping	livestream-shopping	Meet You at the (Virtual) Mall: An Intro to Livestream Shopping	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60f18a9927393d3e8e782f4f_Social%20Shopping%20Artwork%205.png	<p>Do you know what QVC stands for?<br></p><p>The American home shopping channel’s name is short for Quality, Value, Convenience. And for nearly four decades, it has lived up to that name. But now there’s an even more convenient way to shop from the comfort of your home, and it’s called livestream shopping.<br></p><p>For decades, QVC has showed up in viewers’ homes, offering the kind of real-life product demonstrations that were previously only available in showrooms. People could buy blenders and jewelry sets and treadmills from the comfort of their own living rooms by simply picking up the phone and reading out their credit card numbers.<br></p><p>But they were still being sold to by salespeople on a soundstage, people who spoke in slogans and hit their marks.<br></p><p>Livestream shopping is QVC democratized.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It can turn anyone—you, me, your favorite influencer, your neighbor down the block—into a salesperson. They can produce content from their own homes. And the buying process is even simpler: no phone calls required.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In this post, we’ll talk about the impact that livestream shopping is already having in the eCommerce space.<br></p><p>This piece is part of our series <strong>Growth Reimagined: eComm Strategies That Work, No Lease Required</strong>, where we interviewed growth experts in different fields, all of whom have seen a surge of demand from eCommerce companies or have built products and strategies specifically to address those companies’ needs:<br></p><ol><li><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman">The Art of the Pop-Up, Redux</a></li><li><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-future-of-influencer-marketing-is-here-6-trends-from-territorys-rafael-schwarz">The Future of Influencer Marketing Is Here</a></li><li><strong>Meet You at the (Virtual) Mall: An Intro to Livestream Shopping</strong></li><li>Expos and Trade Shows Are Back—We’ll See You There<br></li></ol><p>We talked about how pop-ups are a great way for companies to explore product fit and build brand awareness in a low-stakes way. We revealed that the future of influencer marketing is all about unlocking “nano influencers,” or everyday consumers, and turning them into ambassadors. And now we’ll combine the temporary, space-based activation of pop-ups with the virality of influencer marketing to look at the biggest thing to hit commerce since QVC: livestream shopping.<br></p><h1>What is livestream shopping?<br></h1><p>Livestream shopping works like this: someone streams, or live-records, themselves as they showcase products, and viewers can ask questions, send comments and feedback, and buy the products being shown.&nbsp;</p><h2>Elements of livestream shopping:<br></h2><ul><li>The video feed of the host or influencer showing products and talking</li><li>The chat box where viewers can ask questions and share comments</li><li>The react button to send non-verbal feedback (hearts, likes, etc.)</li><li>The product integration, which usually shows up as a box at the bottom of the video with product details and a purchase button</li><li>Optional: buttons to save the video for later, coupons that are activated upon watching the video, special deals or discounts available to viewers</li></ul><h2>Livestream shopping vs social commerce:<br></h2><p>Livestream shopping is different from social commerce, which is a static ability to make purchases on a social media platform.<br></p><p>It's more personal and interactive than just seeing clothes linked to an influencer’s Instagram page, for example:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60f18aaad32a1a329c698cb1_64JLAsJaSLx537TLg3QHw6yzfQD66fOwFmvfMlIc0w0toeTjbyKjdhEpaEx_Fihc1IojbdZh9DQmM-wWZzhXEDar2yfRM3GM54mN9gbPbctB8Eox1guKhzqCjgbmDp6rUiv9_fNd.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><em>Popular linked shopping platform </em><a href="https://about.liketoknow.it/"><em>LIKEtoKNOWit</em></a><em>, which many Instagram influencers use to share products with followers.</em></p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60f18aa91ac54846c7383a41_KBbT8bZZh3m_U2nasBQxb18QVPVTTqh9SX31ApbYlJncs8i4lg1zUU5MqdF0sTCCk_Jy_XSsOS8yOSwHVKgI8_zniP532Gqbjl2IR0v-5q0mns06Cb6FM4kv9HmICLEJ-sgwMlB-.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><em>This screenshot from the ShopShops app demo shows how livestream shopping makes the product integration more intimate and interactive.</em><br></p><p>Livestream shopping invites consumers into someone’s home or product space, allows them to ask questions in real time, and humanizes the buying process. It’s like having the QVC salesperson in front of you. Viewers can see products up-close and feel a sense of community with a brand—and in a social-distance-friendly way.<br></p><p>Brands can host big shopping “parties” around themes, like creating a Father’s Day shopping spree event to showcase appropriate gifts for dads, or can sell by partnering with individual “hosts” to feature their products in more of an influencer model.<br></p><p>Livestream shopping can happen in-app, like with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/live">Amazon Live</a>, or on separate apps.<br></p><h2>Livestream shopping market size:<br></h2><p>And it’s a quickly-growing market—<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinlarson/2021/03/27/retailers-embrace-livestreaming-market-expected-to-reach-11-billion-in-2021/?sh=5cf411c82fde">Coresight Research estimates</a> the U.S. livestream shopping market to reach $11B by the end of this year, and to more than double by 2023. That’s nothing compared to its impact in China, where it’s slated to hit $300B by the end of 2021.<br></p><h1>Why is livestream shopping appealing to consumers?<br></h1><p>To answer this question, we turned to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiffanyshi/">Tiffany Shi</a>, VP of Product &amp; Growth at <a href="https://shopshops.live/">ShopShops</a>, a livestream shopping platform, and asked her why consumers are more open than ever to try out livestream shopping.<br></p><p>“Our goal is to help our customers shop global like a local,” says Tiffany. “While shops are starting to open up,<strong> our value to our customers is the ability to shop globally</strong> through livestream. You can be sitting on your couch in Brooklyn and shopping for handmade leather bags with one of our hosts in Milan, then swipe and immediately be in Japan walking through cherry blossoms with another host, and shopping for Japanese porcelain plates.”<br></p><p>She anticipates customers sticking around long after the pandemic, too: “Consumers are looking for more authentic ways to connect to shopping—it isn't enough to be able to buy a pair of socks easily on the internet, consumers want to feel more connected to the stores or brands they are shopping from and livestream is a great way to enable that,” explains Tiffany.<br></p><h1>Why is livestream shopping a good idea for retailers?<br></h1><p>Opportunities for brands to increase sales without shelling out for it are always a good idea (that’s why <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">offering warranties is a great way to drive revenue</a>). Livestream shopping is an easy, low-to-no overhead way to experiment in that space, while also increasing customer engagement, says Tiffany.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Brands not only get a new source of revenue, often with very little investment—you can literally go live and sell from your phone—they also get to participate in a whole new way of interacting with their customers [and] build deeper relationships,” she says.</p><h1>How can social shopping add a new angle to other sales and marketing initiatives?<br></h1><p>If our blogs on <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman">pop-ups</a> or <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-future-of-influencer-marketing-is-here-6-trends-from-territorys-rafael-schwarz">influencer marketing</a> convinced you to invest in those areas, great—they integrate really well into a livestream shopping experience.<br></p><p>“Shoppers LOVE a beautifully designed space that helps enhance the value proposition of their products,” says Tiffany. “Pop-ups are a great way to build that kind of experience for shoppers, and livestream is a great way to amplify that experience to shoppers around the world.”<br></p><h1>What does the future of livestream shopping look like?<br></h1><p>Across the board, livestream shopping is evolving from a focus on beauty and fashion (which are well-suited to the showcase model) to be appealing to eCommerce companies of all stripes. Furniture sellers are showcasing what their pieces look like in real settings and how to style them, and technology retailers are sharing how to set up and integrate their products.<br></p><p>Here are the other livestream shopping trends Tiffany expects to see in the space over the next few months:<br></p><ul><li><strong>Likely to follow in Asia’s footsteps.</strong> “I thought the growth would be quite different in the US [than in Asia] because I assumed consumer behavior is different. However, the more I am in the space, the more I realize how similar consumer shopping behavior really is across the globe!” says Tiffany.</li><li><strong>Not necessarily only for younger buyers.</strong> “I expected a younger demographic to be more interested in what we are doing, but we are seeing shoppers of all ages,” she adds.</li><li><strong>$$$. ShopShops is expecting “explosive growth in the next few years,” says Tiffany.</strong><br></li></ul><h1>Ready to try it out?<br></h1><p>Livestream shopping more than meets our rubric for a good marketing initiative: for consumers, it offers authenticity, flexibility, safety, and a community; for retailers, it’s an opportunity to open a new sales channel and drive revenue without much risk, while building brand affinity and experimenting with new products. It has a lot of the same benefits as pop-ups without requiring you to operate out of a physical space, and it lets you connect with consumers no matter where they’re located.<br></p><p>QVC, who?<br></p><p>And stay tuned for our fourth and final post in this series, where we’ll talk about how to make physical spaces of the past—think expos, trade shows, and more—work in our new normal!&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	Mon Jul 19 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
Newsletter May 30	newsletter-may-30	Newsletter: The Industry Drop June 30, 2019	news-updates		<h1>May 30, 2019</h1><p>This month at Clyde we rebranded. We doubled down on our commitment to develop solutions that increase revenue and ease-of-use for all of those retailers smaller than the average rainforest. </p><p>Here’s this segment’s drop on retail and insurance.</p><h2>Upsie raised $5 million <br></h2><p><strong>Upsie further proves consumer demand for product warranties. </strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Direct-to-consumer startup, Upsie raised $5M to provide consumers with a third option for purchasing product warranties. This option being from a third party provider, rather than a manufacturer or retailer, expands the market for consumers to buy the protection they need for their most used items.</p><p>Clarence Bethea, CEO and founder of Upsie took aim at the product insurance industry after recognizing a gap in consumer education. The D2C provider is capitalizing on trends that see consumers going the extra mile in search of transparent and simple solutions. So far the tactic is working. Bethea claims<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2019/upsie-warranty-service-funding/" data-rt-link-type="external"> 300% growth year over year </a>since founding Upsie in 2016. Plans for the $5M round include expanding <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/upsie-secures-5-million-funding-round-led-by-true-ventures-1028239724" data-rt-link-type="external">awareness and warranty product offerings</a>. </p><h2>Shopify <br></h2><p><strong>Shopify expands wholesale with a Handshake. </strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Shopify, as a leader in ecommerce solutions, is throwing more weight behind B2B merchants. Perfect timing as B2B ecommerce sales hit $1T this year and are projected to hit $1.8T by 2023. The Handshake acquisition has been earmarked <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/shopify-handshake-acquisition/" data-rt-link-type="external">below $100M</a> for the b2b wholesale platform and marks and balancing of Shopify’s portfolio, which previously leaned b2c. </p><p>The acquisition is the latest plot twist in Shopify’s eventful growth narrative in recent months. </p><p>Earlier this year Shopify quietly offloaded Mailchimp. Weeks later the email based CRM acquired an ecommerce solution of its own. This development was followed by the launch of Shopify’s Snapchat pixel - a handy advertising integration with business-to-millenial pathway Snapchat. The Handshake purchase which promises better b2b merchant experience signals a steadying of the Shopify ship. </p><h2>Adobe turns the heat up on CRM&nbsp;competition<br></h2><h5><strong>Adobe completed acquisition of Magento right on time for Imagine. </strong></h5><p><strong>‍</strong>The $1.7B acquisition, completed on Tuesday, June 19, had partners and merchants holding their breath on the eve of Magento Imagine summit in Las Vegas. In closing one door it seems Adobe aims to open a highway by retaining former CEO Mark Lavelle to lead the Magento team in Adobe’s Digital Experience business. Magento’s sale to Adobe marks an intensified commitment to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/05/15/adobe-ramps-up-competition-in-customer-experience-management/#6163733b8281" data-rt-link-type="external">compete in the realm of customer experience</a>. Already at odds with CRMs like Salesforce, the addition of Magento can help Adobe round out an all inclusive offering from frontend to back. </p><p>Heavily hued beneath a Photoshop swatch, the 2019, and final, solo show of Magento Imagine was its usual success. The Imagine conference will run alongside Adobe Summit 2020 next Spring. </p><h2>Instagram <br></h2><h5><strong>Instagram released the Kraken, and anything else you want to sell. </strong></h5><p><strong>‍</strong>Over the course of a multi-day rollout, Instagram proved that there is still more opportunity to be wrung from its hyperactive base, now summing 1B MAU. Taking the form of a streamlined path to purchase, the in-app checkout allows users to view a post, click to see the product within and click once more to checkout. </p><p>The addition of payment processing to Instagram is a large step even for advertising behemoth and parent company Facebook. This development moves Facebook closer to the goal of further capitalizing both <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/instagram-launches-checkout-in-the-us-a-feature-that-lets-you-shop-within-the-app-6291511.html" data-rt-link-type="external">Instagram and Messenger</a>. </p><p>For their part, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/instagram" data-rt-link-type="external">Shopify is already offering solutions</a> to help retailers take advantage of this new revenue stream.</p><p><br></p>	Thu May 30 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jericho-shackelford

&nbsp;Customers don’t want to go searching around a site to find help. &nbsp;Easily accessible support demonstrates a company’s willingness and desire to assist customers if they are having trouble with a product. &nbsp;When a company makes support readily accessible, it shows that it stands behind its products and is eager to develop a relationship with its customers. &nbsp;Developing positive relationships with customers is key to retaining their business over time.</p><h5><strong>2. &nbsp;Real-Time Conversations</strong></h5><p>Shoppers want to chat. &nbsp;Real-time conversations started through online support channels have increased at an extremely rapid clip in recent years. &nbsp;In 2014, 50 million conversations were started. &nbsp;In 2015, that number rose to 150 million, and at the start of 2018 nearly 500 million conversations had been started. &nbsp;That’s a huge increase in just four years.</p><h5> </h5><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e3881f66e0cdb24c98bc_01qL0sOtyADDvmWEFnWpbBHpw1U4PHyeslspac9aeCW-lyOKuMPppty-zSaEOPx595nUeXtp95qkBIu2_tXHFPMO1du1CVwaqcvjZxatuTQlmeYkhv9nVkvFkTzq8ASy2nnqui02.png"></div><figcaption><a href="http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends" data-rt-link-type="external">Source: Kleiner Perkins 2018 Internet Trends Report</a></figcaption></figure><p>Utilizing a simple and engaging platform like Zendesk Chat or Intercom to communicate live with customers is a great way to help resolve any issue they may be having. &nbsp;Fast and efficient troubleshooting leads to happy customers, and happy customers are likely to be return shoppers and refer their friends to the brand as well.</p><h5><strong>3. &nbsp;An Understanding of How Your Product Works</strong></h5><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="floatright"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e38816ec99ea72f02230_bH-7yyhuB-JP3bc6opBNMlBpNk4Fv9si1f5s_AW8oZofLi0u0J82How8GPepKIkXl9cVHENeTnyNtTIpMxSh2CPvJgPpMoUpWEbQ9ceUmhrMjg-eKya3HSLc2dFJtrCW8M4v7dVS.png"></div></figure><p>Shoppers want to know how things work. &nbsp;On average, the “How It Works” page of a website is the second most visited page after the homepage. &nbsp;This fact highlights how important it is to be able to answer questions about a product. &nbsp;Shoppers shouldn’t be left scratching their heads. &nbsp;If a website can effectively explain how a product works, those shoppers will be more likely to convert.</p><p>The bar for customer service is getting higher. &nbsp;The companies that are best equipped to meet these elevated expectations will be rewarded with greater customer retention and brand loyalty.</p><p><br></p>	Thu Jul 19 2018 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jacob-stein
Optimize Your eCommerce Shopping Cart With These 11 Best Practices	optimize-your-ecommerce-shopping-cart-with-these-11-best-practices	Optimize Your eCommerce Shopping Cart With These 11 Best Practices	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad861792872915b6a5b_Shopping%20Cart%20Optimization%20Artwork%202.jpg	<p>Traditional shopping carts don’t have much to improve upon. Sure, big box stores can add a more comfortable seat for children, or smoother wheels, or more space. But the base mechanics remain pretty simple: fill a container with stuff, pay for it, wheel it to your car and then take it home.</p><p>eCommerce shopping carts are something else entirely.</p><p>For a shopper to successfully buy from your site, they need to first find the products they’re looking for, then select them in the right type and quantity, and then navigate a checkout process where they add their payment and shipping information.</p><p>Your eCommerce shopping cart is the backbone of that entire journey.</p><p>It’s where customers save their items during their shopping, and it’s where they click—after a few decades of being conditioned to look for it in the upper right corner, after Amazon put theirs there—when they’re done looking around.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also where many eCommerce sellers lose business. Upwards of <strong>70% </strong>of shoppers abandon their shopping cart before checking out, per <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate">UX research firm Baymard Institute</a>. In this article, we explore why—and what you can do about it.</p><h3>Top 5 Reasons Customers Abandon Carts On eCommerce Websites</h3><p>A 70% shopping cart abandonment rate seems high. But remember that eCommerce doesn’t offer the same window-shopping options as traditional retail does, so many users will be comparison shopping, making wishlists, and simply browsing while using the cart feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, there are several common reasons for abandonment, and Baymard surveyed over 4,000 shoppers and found that abandonments that weren’t due to shoppers just browsing were caused by:</p><ol><li><strong>Too-high costs. 49% of non-browsing cart abandonments were because shoppers found shipping, taxes, or other fees to be too high.</strong></li><li><strong>Having to create an account. 24% of shoppers left because they didn’t want to sign up for a store’s account program.</strong></li><li><strong>Too-slow delivery. 19% of buyers clicked out of their cart when they found out when they’d get their purchases and thought it was too late.</strong></li><li><strong>Overly complicated checkout process. 18% of shoppers were turned off by too many steps at checkout.</strong></li><li><strong>Not trusting the site with credit card information. 17% of buyers didn’t trust that their personal financial information would be protected.</strong></li></ol><h3>11 Best Practices For Your eCommerce Shopping Cart Design</h3><p>To avoid losing customers through cart abandonment, you’ll want to design your ecommerce shopping cart and checkout process in line with these best practices:</p><p>1. Give shoppers two useful cart experiences</p><p>A traditional shopping cart page will be full sized, providing a summary of everything a shopper is about to buy. This lets customers make sure that they’ve got everything they need before clicking through to checkout.</p><h4>Example: Superga</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad70316837f060f0a46_J3tUel0C8w4gMtHAJrKODZuuAUtA-32DVZK8kq5Gxfb_TnBd8h-CRUcPxFHdZAq4PsOxv2b1PtxBoDt4cGstW0rasemBr-lbg0KOUGzyloAJrtnyPaeKTZ56dNteB0wgEaDMjUyB%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>A mini cart that pops up and live-updates as customers add things to their cart can enrich the shopping experience, giving them a simplified shortcut view that can be referenced from any page in your ecommerce store.</p><h4>Example: Superga</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad8bea79c4b9f017ef2_SI7xrdZwiVhFhoHgDdmpFZJeOl-jzR6hQ3dUiEfAZm77LhDVZNABbAE10fZpElAnKqLPhPbfrXcCg0vMQc8iz7W9QMFZqb-cFK3wRo7TMoig69HyIqDsl1wPQ5RGuyDaHRSubynV%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>2. Display <strong>all</strong> relevant shipping options&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure you capture customers who are browsing, as well as those who are planning on making an online purchase and shipping it to their home, you’ll want to offer multiple shipping options—and make sure they’re easily findable.&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure your cart options show what’s in-store, if you have retail space; what can be picked up somewhere physical (whether a store or something like an Amazon Locker); and what can be shipped (along with how long it will take).</p><h4>Example: Bed Bath and Beyond</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad8e810e42624753049_G5hXFnnzetJgqizuHO5hWnkSCdkF0_fpsPuSqTHKIywD9ibzvKng7XDVry0k7L7v_X658bWbHft4Zqc8EjxIaSEFJsCVgvYQj2T4kBoOmUJMiYK9T_-5eMxrvPYVzhn_BtHTsKGw%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Take a look at what the home goods giant offers: free store pickup at a local store, as well as shipping options that include the estimated deliverable date.</p><p>3. Ensure customers can see how many items are in their shopping cart</p><p>Make sure you’re designing a useful, simple display to help your customers keep track of how many items they have in their cart. This can help prevent accidental purchases (and thus additional returns and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/6-ecommerce-trends-for-2021">customer service</a> requests).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4>Example: Tokyo 2020 Online Shop</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad7a198adf87928a893_Y0RFro6RFPC5wnD_AlJFO3I0DC8l7ctsrk3jHdW36yxgNci_dF0-rR6uTT0DhD3nVmH1ZmbpoNhJ8SvNF_9dgjmVVOgjHw4ZMhL6PnytR86zK_JcZBJ8ZBmLPmLOvovP-iHOFOVv%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>Looking to buy Olympic gear? The online shop for the Olympic Games tells shoppers clearly and cleanly, with a constantly-updated red circle integrated with their shopping cart, how many items they have in their cart.</p><p>4. Allow customers to easily adjust the quantity of items from their cart</p><p>Letting customers adjust the number of any given item from the cart page directly, versus making them return to the actual item page to add more, can make it easier for shoppers to buy more (or, when necessary, remove items) from the same page.</p><h4>Example: Minted</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad74fba8370f533113f_9vv0zd_l3mSIR0crzWay68lljL6gHuFzqV8wTM_CiXJPQNyvlXtlFaomgzQDzFQOm2ohCiP7lfd0JlWHxkqA1gGxVIH7nwBwwWmC4Qc9LjziSQ0HynmGc2aXTrXnEjAiGGXbU68a%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Bonus points to Minted for including pricing updates alongside quantity updates. This page could be improved, though, by having a “0” option in the quantity bar for shoppers who changed their mind (though they do have the “remove” button above the product details).</p><p>5. Make cross-selling products a part of your ecommerce cart design</p><p>Optimizing your ecommerce cart is all about improving your sales. Why not go a step further and help customers as well as your sales numbers by suggesting additional items that go along with what’s already in their cart? Try the same thing with upselling, too.</p><h4>Example: B&amp;H<br></h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad7c8952e661034af36_aSGZdGMdpHDtWJQ7xePPGZCXgP66JxsLfdzj3Bf9k-ijqvJqmTOF41HCOE22y0STPEacpH3rrkTEfITbJp1HcI3H3W-bYjRafuGgY1Qz9cZDPa12_FPxfQd_f7VqoelT8AWBVj0W%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>After a customer has added a camera to their cart, B&amp;H serves them related items, from memory cards (helpfully labeled “essential,” as the camera really won’t hold much without one) to rechargeable batteries.</p><p>6. Provide trust seals to ensure your customers that their identity and purchase information is secure</p><p>While most customers will have plenty of experience sharing their credit card information on the internet, it never hurts to reassure customers that your checkout process is a secure one. (Especially with headlines about <a href="https://lawstreetmedia.com/tech/class-action-settlement-against-bombas-and-shopify-approved-by-court/">class action settlements</a> won against ecomm companies who didn’t secure their customers’ data!)<br></p><h4>Example: Asos</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad7049369a37d11b409_Dnx8QyMY47b1L0JXsa4heQg0YKXfpYjApoj20h1dTvESuieLq4zpzlshAwvaCBBBb977QxUiVxG2TS9vOlJDcDMGmHAdPw-9EE5TkietzOCFCQCryAwuABCaFjGdWnr09JA19JHt%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>See the digicert logo in the upper righthand corner of the checkout window? It assures customers that their name, address, email, and credit card information will be protected.</p><p>7. Allow for guest checkout</p><p>Not every buyer is going to want to sign up with an official account on your website in order to complete one order, and you run the risk of losing their business entirely if you force them to do so. Make sure you offer a guest checkout option for customers in a hurry.<br></p><h4>Example: Warby Parker<br></h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad7ee479b6b6fcb8a93_QpjlmmAD9VKa1am4O131o4UOnKlIWY6ur4V76P1FfvlXLtbXMgdlLztV1XWUzwYH8wbxEFOLCzv3o9rhc119ghawRlW-KrCR204HtTuzSlaNCVVvtLgaan6ClbDXgxZQ3OcsH8gT%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>While the vision giant probably wants customers to sign up and stay loyal, they’re happy to give buyers a guest checkout option to keep things moving.&nbsp;</p><p>8. Offer a mobile-friendly cart experience and include popular digital wallets</p><p>50% of 2022’s eCommerce will take place on mobile phones, reports <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelleykohan/2020/02/09/mobile-commerce-to-grow-68-by-2022-as-more-people-shop-on-their-phones/?sh=1f29340e652d"><em>Forbes</em></a>. If your site isn’t designed for mobile already, it’s time to make sure it is now. Integrations like Shop Pay can keep mobile-first checkout experiences streamlined and easy, and adding digital wallets like ApplePay and GooglePay, among others, will make it simple for customers to buy from their phones.</p><h4>Example: Lumecube</h4><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad83a93114c2546ecfe_CehsCDX2sCLuLFubsVj5ocTUyk_geFJwKUOcIH0Oi4B6q68_Dz_yGhQOQtJ4j3WmI_J5N5Mk-b7G0cVMUwFZfKCI4LNSimNmZvvHyreAVc0jXfHoEY97Kf7UdJrC0eTiDS95waqG%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Purchasing a ring light from Lumecube is just as easy on mobile as it is via a web browser, with clear steps and multiple payment options available in each place.</p><p>9. Offer gift wrapping and make it easy to find&nbsp;</p><p>Buyers who are shopping for someone else want to make sure that their purchase can be successfully delivered as a gift. Including gift wrapping options early on in the checkout process, and making them obvious, can make your site a favorite for gift shoppers.</p><h4>Example: West Elm<br></h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad8bc3ee31e3db545be_8gNqgC9AlibKZ2pSgpGu9yV4edZ5X1W3DY15spDMtd-ZyjBMH7OH6RILa-SOvxUt04j5FGtJQ9GbaRhLSQf_ch6uea8aNUc8c70UvjmRg788TVw8gfVD-IFgi5A968bWaXTQLsAF%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>West Elm has packaged their gift options along with their delivery options, and has even included helpful guidance on whether pricing will be shown—it won’t—so that gift buyers have everything they need for a successful purchase.</p><p>10. Include a clear order summary</p><p>Shoppers will often double check that what they’ve put in their cart is exactly what they need, which can mean reviewing sizing, quantity, price, shipping information, or store policies like return and exchange policies. Make it easy on them by including that context in an easy-to-skim summary page.&nbsp;</p><h4>Example: Sur La Table</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad79019b7dbcf91ec8c_6QLdL3Ihk0KmlDBDTThYIjE348Llx_Gfz0QgZKpchF7_7M2B-hWLoYI1SZxYsVbkBxQgqwlL0_ZGCPyBOBhoRtkhMWpAcaRG05LjSifB2_Fx3WWoq5b7YWcdebZWNeLRzx5PuY_n%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>Right before checking out, a Sur La Table shopper is served with this little box that clarifies the size, name, shipping time, and cancelation options for their chosen product(s), improving the chances that the customer doesn’t have to navigate away from checkout to double-check anything.&nbsp;</p><p>11. Put a timer on carts<br></p><p>As we talked about above, some customers are just browsing, and you’re unlikely to convince those that they need to purchase something right now. But some customers <em>can</em> be swayed with a little time crunch, and adding a clear timer to your cart that lets customers know how long you’ll hold their selections can help nudge them in the direction of checkout.&nbsp;<br></p><h4>Example: Asos</h4><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/613a3ad70c3cbfc8352296fe_PfiKz4Fbz4IVaGOepLNioztGOSTX4f8Bn__NnCr4_kFyPkc0WNnhz8DTTLX2JRJRhjKz2Ya1erYiFCvDWfl9GPGqyt8nUkXs3g_tEj49InOFNx-PMWeTJKwM_9GIsW_HyflCmkDf%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>This cart timer is plenty long enough, at an hour, and updates as the shopper continues to look for items, so that they always know how much time is left before they need to complete checkout.</p><h3>Learn More About Optimizing Your eCommerce Checkout Process With Clyde</h3><p>This article has focused mostly on ways that you can optimize your shopping cart experience with layout and UI.

Out of the Box: Balmuda	out-of-the-box-balmuda	Out of the Box: the Balmuda Toaster	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ecd1533ec8bd707844ca8a3_Frame%2025.png	<figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4z32ut5f8c0"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>We work with some pretty cool retailers, so we decided to launch our very own series of unboxing videos, showcasing some of the innovative designs from our partners—from consumer electronics to sporting goods and more.<br></p><p>First up is the <a href="https://us.balmuda.com/collections/toaster">Balmuda toaster</a>. Balmuda is a Japanese small appliance company that recently launched in the United States, much to my delight. I’ve been eyeing their beautifully designed toaster and kettle for awhile now.&nbsp;<br></p><p>They chose to partner with Clyde to offer their customers extended warranties at the point of sale (and are already seeing an impressive attachment rate above 20%). One of the reasons that we love Balmuda is their focus on the customer experience, which very much aligns with our focus at Clyde. I was impressed with Balmuda’s website, which features recipes, how-tos, technical specifications, and beautiful imagery. I purchased my toaster (with a Clyde protection plan, of course) and received it only two days later.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ec556b5af64256b24c75723_Screen%20Shot%202020-04-29%20at%209.26.01%20AM.png"></div><figcaption>A&nbsp;Clyde call-to-action on Balmuda's site</figcaption></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>One of the many cool things about the Balmuda toaster is that it took over two thousand design iterations to arrive at the final product. Balmuda uses steam heat to create toast that is crisp on the outside, yet moist and chewy on the inside. The toaster has five distinct settings for different types of bread, including sandwich bread mode, artisan bread mode, pastry mode, and even pizza mode. Anyone who has ever tasted the floppy disaster that is reheated microwaved pizza can appreciate this setting.<br></p><p>As far as the unboxing goes, the product was packed beautifully and securely, and I was able to unpack and assemble it within minutes (without reading the instruction manual, no less). I’m a&nbsp; fan of anything that intuitive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The final result was crunchy without being dry, which I enjoyed with some butter and jam. If you’re currently working on your cooking skills, as many of us are, I highly recommend this product. Now excuse me while I make some nachos.</p><p><br></p>	Tue May 26 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	james-godwin
Pamela Schneider Joins Clyde As Vice President of Warranty	pamela-schneider-joins-clyde-as-vice-president-of-warranty	Pamela Schneider Joins Clyde As Vice President of Warranty	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5ff8762a0c25313351a9ae4d_Option%20One.png	<p>This week, Clyde announced that Pamela Schneider will be joining the company as its new Vice President of Warranty.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Schneider has been steering financial services and insurance companies to new heights of performance and profitability for over two decades. In recent years, Pam served in a series of executive positions for The Warranty Group, which was one of the world’s leading providers of warranty solutions and related insurance products, with operations in over 35 countries and&nbsp; more than $5 Billion in assets before it was acquired by Assurant. As VP of the Andean Region in South America, she held full P&amp;L accountability and provided bold ideas and forward-thinking leadership to optimize marketing, sales, business strategy, and operations in Colombia, Peru, and Chile.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In 2018, she launched Crescimento, Inc., a strategic consulting firm catering to organizations in the insurance, financial services, fintech, and insurtech space.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“As Clyde’s warranty arm develops, Pam will be an invaluable partner and guide to the team. Pam’s vision as a skilled strategist pairs perfectly with her executional track record within the warranty space,” said Clyde CEO, Brandon Gell. “As a technology company, we can only solve problems that we truly understand. With Pam’s guidance, we can help businesses overcome their most challenging obstacles, while innovating in new and exciting ways.”<br></p><p>“As the warranty space continues to evolve, it’s the perfect time to begin my journey with Clyde,” said Schneider. “This company’s technology platform has the potential to provide its customers with more value and innovation than anyone else in the industry. It’s that ambition and potential that drew me to Clyde.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>We sat down with Pam over the holidays to discuss what drew her to Clyde and why she’s so excited for what lies ahead.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What drew you to Clyde?</strong></h3><p>I have worked in this industry for a long time and have mentored insurtech companies during the past three years, so my interests and expertise align perfectly with Clyde. Once I met Brandon and Jereme it became clear that they had the vision and the passion to transform this industry. And that’s exactly what this space needs, new leadership to reimagine things from the ground up. And because I’m joining at this time in the company’s history, I have a chance to start fresh, without being encumbered by a bunch of constraints. That’s a truly exciting proposition to me and allows me to use my skill set fully from day one.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What needs to change within the warranty space and what should be left intact?</strong></h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/600095c039bcc0c41275b88c_Pamela%20Schneider.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Consumers were drawn to warranties in the first place because of the promise of peace of mind. People purchase coverage because they want to know if something goes wrong that they are covered and that the company they bought it from has a simple solution, be it a repair or a replacement. That remains true regardless of the business model.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of that core concept of protection, the industry is really ripe for transformation. For starters, the entire process has, historically, not been customer-centric. The main focus for companies was to drive revenue, which is undoubtedly important. But you don’t need to sacrifice the customer experience to drive revenue. When I was at The Warranty Group, we would discuss the benefits of a simplified claims process for customers. If you reimagine claims by making it as easy as scanning a barcode, or inputting a few pieces of data, all of a sudden you could create a user-friendly experience. And while that hasn’t been the standard within the industry, an enhanced user experience is certainly in line with what other consumer-facing sectors are creating. Simplifying the claims process by taking it online is just a single example of what a company like Clyde is doing, that a traditional legacy provider would be hard pressed to accomplish.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Why should manufacturers (OEMs) be interested in working with Clyde?</strong></h3><p>As a sector that sells a lot of warranties, OEMs have the potential to use Clyde in a plug and play manner at scale. Traditional legacy providers simply can’t help them the way that Clyde can, and in some cases those providers aren’t even willing to compete in that space. And I know for a fact that there are a lot of manufacturers who are running their own programs that would be thrilled to utilize Clyde’s technology to enhance their customers' experience. Manufacturers are ready to leverage technology, they just need to be shown the value and taught the process so that they can utilize a platform like Clyde to run their existing programs.&nbsp;<br></p>	Thu Jan 14 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese
Partner Spotlight: Hawke Media Perfecting The Outsourced CMO Model	partner-spotlight-hawke-media-perfecting-the-outsourced-cmo-model	Partner Spotlight: Hawke Media Perfecting The Outsourced CMO Model	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61f02d1329a9c273756356f6_Partner%20Spotlight%20-%20Katapult%20(3).png	<p>At Clyde, our goal from the very beginning has been to help our merchants operate their businesses more effectively while generating additional revenue. And while we are proud of the technology we’ve built and the service we provide, we understand that warranty and product protection programs are just one piece of the puzzle.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Remaining competitive within the eCommerce industry requires merchants to work with a host of third party vendors. A point of emphasis for us in 2022 will be to help our merchants connect with as many impactful vendors as possible within our hub. Merchants can gain access to critical technology and expertise which will allow them to leverage their data to achieve their business goals.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In our on-going series, we’re spotlighting our growing list of partners who are helping merchants all over the country. To kick off this series, Hawke Media's &nbsp;Vice President of Partnerships, Ashley Scorpio, was kind enough to explain why so many merchants utilize their services, while answering a few of our questions as well. </p><h3>An Introduction To Hawke Media</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61f02343b3d7331dd59a43cb_HawkeMedia_LogoTag_Red.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Hawke Media is an award-winning digital marketing consultancy and full-service agency. Hawke was founded on the idea that every modern business needs a CMO-level expert to lead digital marketing efforts. We customize data-driven, performance-focused solutions to help launch, scale, and invigorate businesses of all sizes, industries, and revenue models. We’re shifting the agency paradigm by putting client success ahead of our own. Our comprehensive à la carte menu of services and month-to-month contracts mean you get only what you need, when you need it.<br></p><p>Clyde and Hawke work together to give clients access to new revenue streams, expanded customer touchpoints, and more opportunities to build positive customer relationships beyond the point of sale.<br></p><p>As the managed service provider, Hawke makes sure that your business gets the most out of Clyde starting from integration with your legacy systems to ongoing management. We have the know-how so you don’t have to waste your time, effort, and money training our finding a team to outsource to. And as the first member of Clyde’s partner program no one’s as close to the source as we are, so you get exclusive access to new features and benefits.</p><h3><strong>How do you quantify the impact that marketing can have on a growing business? What are some key metrics, success stories that you reference?</strong><br></h3><p>There are so many important metrics to consider when growing your business and what you should focus on really depends on your industry, goals, strategies and more.<br></p><p>A few that are important across the board for everyone are things like:</p><ol><li>Customer Acquisition Cost</li><li>Customer Lifetime Value</li><li>Conversion Rates</li><li>Cost Per Click</li><li>Return on Investment</li></ol><p>These metrics can help you determine how the money you’re spending is working for you and can guide future adjustments as needed.<br></p><p>One KPI that we talk about a lot at Hawke Media is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). CLV&nbsp;looks at the amount of income a customer generates for your business over the course of your relationship with them. It can be weeks, days or years depending on the service offering and back-end product. It is well known that keeping existing customers coming back for more is much more efficient than continually trying to acquire new customers. Successful CLV is tied closely to not only your product/service, but also a great customer experience.</p><h3><strong>As an "outsourced CMO" what kind of projects do you generally start with for companies that are seeking exposure and access to a broader customer base?<br></strong></h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61f024bd9d60ea8623d8fc5d_Ashley%20Scorpio%20-%20Headshot%203.jpg" loading="lazy"></div><figcaption>Ashley Scorpio, Vice President of Partnerships at Hawke Media</figcaption></figure><p>Depending on goals, budgets, and more, there are many different places we’ll start&nbsp;with a new brand.<br></p><p>It’s important to make sure they are set for success on the backend&nbsp; before launching marketing campaigns and have integrated the right solutions partners for their business. That may be things like ESPs, CDPs, automation, fulfillment, payments etc. If a business doesn’t have the right tools and isn’t running smoothly, it’s hard to do anything else.<br></p><p>Beyond that most businesses start with optimizations in areas like onsite SEO, content, and paid digital advertising across a mix of platforms. All of these things help ensure people are discovering your brand in the way you want, at the times you want. It’s hard to start driving sales without awareness or credibility and these are great ways to fill the top of your funnel.<br></p><h3><strong>In the new eCommerce landscape do you find more companies or willing to spend for services like yours today as opposed to pre-pandemic spending?</strong></h3><p>Of course, we’re seeing many brands with tighter budgets and constraints on spending than they had before the pandemic. But at the same time we’re seeing many companies that are prioritizing their marketing as they are now seeing the benefits to them tenfold with the shifts that have happened in the last two years. With the huge increase in online shopping and selling throughout the pandemic, brands are looking for more ways to find their target consumer online in particular as less people are out and about. As online consumption continues to grow across demographics, things like paid search and social, marketplace optimization, SEO, content, email, SMS, and more become more and more important.<br></p><h3><strong>What are you most excited about in the next six months when it comes to your product and functionality?<br></strong></h3><p>Our service offering at Hawke Media continues to grow and expand. We recently acquired an incredible development shop in Canada which was our first internal expansion. We are pleased to offer local talent to our Canadian clients and a more robust web development practice. We are also growing beyond digital marketing channels to offering services ranging from print to OOH advertising.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What are you most excited about for the next 6-12 months in eCommerce overall? Any trends? Predictions? </strong></h3><p>I am excited to see how brands adapt to the ongoing cookie changes happening online.&nbsp;</p><p>Brands are going to have to try and find unique ways to continue to collect and elicit customer data. The changes can be catastrophic to any brands that aren’t prepared but those who are thoughtful and plan ahead will continue to flourish and grow. I think we’re going to start seeing who is prepared and how they are doing, so more brands will likely follow suit with zero and first party data. <br></p>	Tue Jan 25 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

As a financial technology company, Katapult provides cutting-edge technology that integrates seamlessly with online platforms, enabling our retail partners to expand their customer base, increase transactions, and grow revenue. Katapult's consumer-centric focus ensures an efficient application and approval process while providing transparent and tailored payment terms. Katapult partners with hundreds of retailers across the United States and millions of approved consumers to create new opportunities for point-of-sale transactions.<br></p><p>Our partnership with Clyde enables retailers to better serve nonprime consumers by offering a checkout experience in which shoppers can easily lease-purchase goods and add an extended warranty plan. Using Clyde and Katapult together, consumers can pay for their product and extended warranty over time, with the extended warranty portion not subject to lease related charges.&nbsp;</p><h3>How much education is required for consumers to understand your product? Has the BNPL boom done the educational work for you?</h3><p>Although the BNPL boom has helped educate consumers on the many options now available at checkout, it has not completely educated the consumer about lease-to-own options. While similar, BNPL and LTO are two very different solutions. <a href="https://go.katapult.com/hubfs/B2B-%20Marketing%20Materials/Katapult_WP_1021.pdf">Our whitepaper illustrates the differences between BNPL and LTO.</a> &nbsp;There is still a long way to go in changing the narrative around LTO through transparency and continued education for both retailers and consumers. <br></p><h3>For the merchants you work with, is there any risk associated with these programs and if so who bears those financial risks?</h3><p>As with other checkout solutions, there is a fraud and non-payment risk with any transaction. Katapult mitigates fraud risk as much as possible with proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify and vet out fraud applications and approve qualified candidates. When it comes to non-payment or returning items, Katapult takes on that responsibility as the consumer who started the lease agreement with Katapult is now our customer and our first priority is to treat each customer with respect. <br></p><h3>From a data perspective, are you able to quantify the number of customers that your tech/financing unlocks for eCommerce merchants?</h3><p>We can’t share specific numbers of customers that Katapult brings to each of our retail partners, but can share that we maintain our own database of approved applicants to whom we then market our retail partners to encourage return to cart, checkout, and repeat purchase behavior. We worked with PYMNTS.com this fall on a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2021/buy-now-pay-later-lease-to-own-payments-convert-customers-merchants-otherwise-ignore/">consumer survey</a> that attempted to quantify how many customers were sitting on the sidelines without the benefit of access to BNPL&nbsp;and LTO&nbsp;options. </p><div></div><h3>What are you most excited about in the next six months when it comes to your product and functionality?</h3><p>We are excited about the new enhancements we’ll be bringing to our existing and potential retail partners that will not only help them capture more transactions but will also help Katapult continue its mission for consumer transparency and ease of use. </p><h3>What are you most excited to see in the next 6-12 months in eCommerce space? Any trends? Predictions?</h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:35%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61e6fb809d62ea4c2586e7c1_Katapult%20CEO%20Orlando%20Zayas.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption>Orlando Zayas, Chief Executive Officer of Katapult</figcaption></figure><p>We are excited about the continued adoption of alternative payment options and the inclusion that creates for consumers. There are many opportunities for new offerings, partnerships, and an expansion of access to the growing number of online and omnichannel retail activities. Consumers are showing their willingness to adopt these new technologies and their preference for new ways to interact and pay, but they want great experiences, trusted partners, and transparency. This creates significant opportunities for merchants relying on traditional programs to embrace the digital and data-driven approach and grow their marketplace.<br></p><p>There is a massive market opportunity that continues to expand with the adoption of digital transaction types. From an industry standpoint, there is a rising wave of focus and adoption of eCommerce, POS financing, and digital servicing strategies that are garnering more attention.<br></p>	Fri Jan 21 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

Customers benefit, too, since registering their products means:<br></p><ul><li>Being able to easily report any issues or request repair or replacement</li><li>Getting communication about any recalls or product notices</li><li>Accessing set-up instructions and use guidance</li><li>Making a record of their purchase in case they need to return the product or order another</li><li>Unlocking unique discounts, product previews, and freebies<br></li></ul><p>Here, we’ll explore the best practices for your product registration process to make it easier for both you and your customers:<br></p><h2>Best Practices For Product Registration</h2><h3>1) Make It Easier For Customers' Products to Be Registered</h3><p>A <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/116020/103219.pdf?sequence=1">survey of 500+ consumers</a> conducted by the University of Michigan found that people want to register their products—they just don’t like the effort required to do so.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Check out these key stats:<br></p><ul><li>31% of people always or usually register their purchases, and 24% sometimes do</li><li>78% of people are more likely to register expensive products</li><li>32% of those who seldom or never register their products don’t do so because they’re “<strong>forgetful or lazy</strong>”</li><li>44% of people who seldom or never register products avoid doing so because it <strong>takes too much time </strong>or is <strong>inconvenient</strong><br></li></ul><p>Simplifying the process can go a long way in boosting your registration numbers. Try:<br></p><ul><li>Making it entirely digital, and mobile-friendly—per a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/04/26/1450773/0/en/New-Study-Millennials-and-Affluent-Consumers-Want-to-Connect-with-Brands-Immediately-Post-Purchase-via-Mobile.html">Registria survey</a>, 47% of younger consumers (those aged 18-34) would prefer mobile registration (versus email or paper); you can capture this market by having purchases take a picture of a registration icon on their product and sending it in via text or messaging app&nbsp;</li><li>Providing a simple QR code so purchases can scan it, pre-populate a simple form with their information, and be done</li><li>Asking for just the basics at first—name and email—to minimize what customers have to fill out, and slowly ask for more information as time goes on (you can do this with <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/how-startups-like-doe-lashes-are-gamifying-data-collection-to-combat-privacy-updates/">gamified elements like quizzes</a>, per Modern Retail!)</li></ul><h3>2) Do a Better Job of Explaining the Value of Registering a Product</h3><p>Registration can be confusing. Make sure to answer, whether in a FAQ that comes with each purchase or as part of post-registration communication, common questions.</p><h4>Example Registration FAQ<br></h4><ul><li><strong>Is registration the same thing as a warranty or insurance? </strong>No. While some products may come with an automatic warranty, whether limited or full coverage, and registering a product might secure it, not all product registration includes warranties. You might have additional options to buy add-on coverage, though.</li><li><strong>What happens if I don’t register? </strong>Nothing bad. You keep your product and go on your merry way. But if you have issues with it, want to access support or set-up help, or want to receive communication from the manufacturer, including about recalls or future product drops, you’ll miss out on an easy channel to do that.</li><li><strong>If I register, will I be bombarded with marketing communications?</strong> No. You can opt-in to receiving proactive marketing communications, if you’d like. Otherwise, you’ll just get safety information and access to our support center.</li></ul><h3>3) Collect Contact Info For Meaningful Post-Purchase Engagement with Your Brand</h3><p>All you need your initial product registration to do is get some information on your buyers (demographic info is great, but contact info is the priority) and whether they opt-in to additional communication from you or not.<br></p><p>Anything else—like getting product feedback—is just the cherry on top.<br></p><p>As we wrote about in our report on the <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">Touchpoint Trojan Horse</a>, transactional emails are one of the few types of emails that customers regularly open.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So whether you’ve gotten your registrants to sign up for your marketing outreach or not, take full advantage of registration emails to meaningfully engage with your customers by:<br></p><ul><li>Thanking them for their purchase</li><li>Inviting them to share a review or photos of the product</li><li>Giving them access to exclusive content or discounts<br></li></ul><p>You can use <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-ecommerce-technology-works-together">microservices</a> to do much of this, like by running exclusive email or SMS campaigns with a provider like <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/">Klaviyo</a>.</p><h3>4) Make Sure Registration Enhances the Ownership Experience</h3><p>Even the best-designed, fastest-to-complete registration process will take <em>some</em> time, so compensate your customers for it.<br></p><p>You want to give them access to something that makes registration worth it. You can take several approaches to do that:</p><h4>Education</h4><p>Enhance their use of your product by providing well-designed resources on how to setup, use, and care for it. Whether you send a slick ebook or a link to funny YouTube videos, deploy enablement content to give customers something extra that’s worth registering for.</p><h4>Exclusivity</h4><p>Identify and activate your super-owners—the brand advocates who are excited about not just your product but about the company that made it—by giving them exclusivity. This can look like behind-the-scenes video on production, an invitation to a registrants-only AMA with product designers, access to community events with other superusers, or early product information and access.</p><h4>Financial savings</h4><p>Some buyers will have bought your product because it was the best-priced option on the market. Keep them engaged by offering discount codes, early access to sales, lifetime free shipping, and free digital products.</p><h3>5) Leverage Your Invested Customer’s Loyalty to Improve Upsell, Cross-Sell, and Service Plan Sales</h3><p>Not every buyer will register.<br></p><p>Not every registrant will opt-in to get marketing communication from you.<br></p><p>But those who do? That’s a core set of invested, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-product-protection-increases-customer-ltv-and-drives-loyalty">loyal customers</a>—and you should be giving them options to continue to engage with your products and company.<br></p><p>Maybe they’re enthusiastic purchases of your workout equipment, and you can see that they’ve opened and engaged with communications on how to safely set up and use their products. Why not send them customized product offers that can add new functionality into their exercise routines? Or invite them to get first access to the deluxe version of your product?<br></p><p>Check out these <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/8-upselling-examples-and-tips-that-increase-order-values">8 upselling examples and tips</a> for more inspiration as you get started.<br></p><p>And if you have a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/protection-plan-coverage">product protection plan</a> or service offering—which you should!—make sure you communicate that to this group.&nbsp;</p><h2>Product Registration Software That Makes This Easy</h2><p>You don’t have to go it at product registration alone. Using registration software can create a near frictionless experience for your customers while also delivering you the exact data insights you need to make more informed product and marketing decisions.<br></p><p>Options include:<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.registria.com/">Registria</a></li><li><a href="https://www.tavant.com/product-registration">Tavant</a></li><li><a href="https://www.modyo.com/">Modyo</a></li></ul><h3>Clyde and Registria’s Registration Software</h3><p>We partnered with Registria, the industry leader in product registration, to ensure Clyde vendors can offer a great ownership experience to their customers, no matter where or what they’re selling.</p><h3>Key features</h3><ul><li>Automatic owner onboarding flows</li><li>Integration with sales and communication channels (like WhatsApp and SMS) and support channels (like chat bots and websites)</li><li>Integration with voice-enabled home devices&nbsp;</li><li>International language support</li><li>Owner analytics and KPIs</li></ul><h3>How Clyde is Automating Product Registration For Your Customers</h3><p>As a retailer, data helps you figure out:<br></p><ul><li>What to sell</li><li>Who to sell it to</li><li>How much to sell it for</li><li>How you promote it</li><li>How to prioritize improvements on all of the above.<br></li></ul><p>Employing a simple product registration journey can lead to huge gains in data acquisition—and from there, to all of the other metrics that you care about.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And since Clyde exists to empower eCommerce businesses, we set out to bring the best product registration product to our clients.<br></p><p>Working with Registria makes it easy for our merchants to connect to the customers who buy their products via a third party.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Learn more about our partnership with Registria, and talk to a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">product expert</a> today.<br></p>	Thu Feb 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
How Product Warranties Fit With Customer Loyalty	product-warranties-customer-loyalty	How Product Warranties Fit With Customer Loyalty	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc704f2405a7afec376dfe3_Blog_Umbrellas.1.png	<p>Converting one-time shoppers into repeat customers is one of the most important tasks for scaling a successful business. If you have a product that customers love, then you’re off to a great start. However, generating loyalty and, as a result, increasing customer lifetime value (CLV) isn’t a passive process. There are actually specific measures businesses can take to develop a loyal cohort of customers. One step that retailers can take to increase CLV is to offer product insurance plans. </p><p>Beyond their ability to pad retailers’ bottom lines (<a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-reports-holiday-2015-revenue-results/" data-rt-link-type="external">it is estimated</a> that Best Buy makes around half of its annual profit from the sale of extended warranties), product insurance plans are one of the best ways businesses can actively increase CLV and drive loyalty.</p><h3>What is Customer Lifetime Value?</h3><p>A major service contract market <a href="https://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20170309.html" data-rt-link-type="external">study</a> found that not only do customers who invest in product protection plans report a higher level of satisfaction with their purchase, but these customers also tend to be more brand- and store-loyal shoppers. Here is how this translates into increased CLV and loyalty.</p><p>What exactly is “customer lifetime value (CLV)?”. CLV is a prediction of the profit driven from the entire relationship, from now into the future, with a given customer. CLV is a strong indicator of a business’s viability because it forecasts how it is likely to perform down the road. If customers tend to return to a given retailer and make purchases over the span of a few years, their lifetime value will be high, and the business will have an easier time succeeding. Increasing loyalty and satisfaction is so important because customers who return to shop often have high CLV and will keep businesses thriving.</p><h3>Happy customers are repeat customers.</h3><p>If the customer completes a purchase satisfied with the entire shopping experience, they are far more likely to return and increase their lifetime value to the retailer. Shopping is an emotional experience, especially if you’re shopping for something you know you’re going to enjoy using, like a fancy flatscreen TV or the new iPhone. Studies have found that happiness while shopping is correlated with aversion to risk. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/business/08every.html" data-rt-link-type="external">Research suggests</a> that the happier a person is about the purchase they’re about to make, the more risk averse they will become and the more likely they will be to purchase a protection plan. This makes sense because the happier someone is about something, the more they will care about it and seek to protect or defend it. The availability of protection plans can settle shoppers’ fear of loss, increase their overall happiness with their purchase, and encourage repeat business.</p><h3>Product Protection attracts shoppers who tend to be loyal.</h3><p>It turns out that shoppers who report being more loyal to certain brands and stores invest in product protection more frequently than shoppers who float between different brands and stores. The availability of product protection plans can attract a segment of shoppers that tend to be more loyal and naturally have a higher CLV. They will make repeat purchases from a given retailer and drive future business.</p><h3>What happens if a product fails?</h3><p>Product protection plans offer retailers the opportunity to ensure their customers have a net positive experience in the event that their product is damaged. Protection plans provide recourse in the event a product fails. When a shopper purchases a protection plan, they agree to its terms of service, which spell out the conditions under which coverage will be provided and how. If something does go wrong, the possibility of a disagreement between the retailer and the customer is limited if the corrective course of action is already established. Protection plans are a valuable tool for maintaining strong relationships with customers and increase the likelihood that their business will be retained even if their product is damaged or breaks.</p><p>Retailers actually do have a ton of leverage when it comes to developing customer loyalty. The loyalty of your customers is by no means something that is out of your hands. Offering customers product protection at checkout is just one effective way to increase CLV. It works because customers are ultimately happier with their purchase when it is protected, because shoppers who invest in protection plans are typically more loyal shoppers, and because these plans provide customers a plan of action in the event their product does fail, ensuring that their issue is handled fairly and swiftly.</p>	Sun Apr 28 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jacob-stein

What Clyde has proven over the course of the last year is that offering protection plans through a delightful customer experience leads to <em>more</em> protection plan sales and even greater customer loyalty. To date, Clyde’s average attachment rate has more than doubled the industry’s average.</p><p>But Clyde isn’t solely focused on selling more protection plans. The relationship between Clyde and the customer continues after a protection plan is bought, and so today we took another huge step in developing the best product protection experience in the industry.</p><h1>An End-to-End Customer Experience<br></h1><p>Today we’re thrilled to announce the re-launch of <a href="https://www.hiclyde.com/get-contract">hiclyde.com</a>, our end customer-facing portal. <a href="https://www.hiclyde.com/get-contract">Hiclyde.com</a> has been entirely revamped to provide the most seamless process for buying coverage, managing purchases, viewing terms of coverage, and filing a claim.</p><p>We understand that Clyde’s responsibilities to customers do not end after they have checked out from a store and bought coverage. A product protection program is only as strong as its ability to resolve customers’ issues, so unless the claims experience is simple, easy to navigate, and yields positive outcomes, the sale of a protection plan alone is not going to produce a repeat customer. In re-building our customer portal, Clyde has created a superior, truly end-to-end product protection experience that will help stores close the customer loyalty loop.</p><h1>How it works:</h1><h2>Create an account</h2><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1579px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5d8bdb5a1bf4010000f6de94_HC_Create_Account.png"></div></figure><p>Customers create an account on <a href="https://www.hiclyde.com/get-contract">hiclyde.com</a> with the email they used when they checked out from a store.

Customers of our partner stores will now have 30-60 days to purchase a protection plan on <a href="https://www.hiclyde.com/get-contract">hiclyde.com</a> after they’ve checked out from the store. Customers who have purchased an eligible product will be automatically enrolled in a co-branded email cadence promoting the appropriate protection plan.</p><h2>Review your contract terms and file a claim</h2><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1563px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5d8bdb971bf401552cf6e83e_HC%20PDP.png"></div></figure><p>Customers can view a summary of the terms of their coverage, in plain English, on <a href="https://www.hiclyde.com/get-contract">hiclyde.com</a> at any time.

Release: New Platform Launch for Product Protection	release-new-platform-launch-for-product-protection	Release: Clyde Launches Platform to Capture Consumer Demand for Product Protection	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc7b5e7e4c2187f4b1cb2d7_Blog_Clyde%20News%20Image.png	<p>New York - May 1, 2019, Clyde has launched a new technology platform allowing online retailers to offer seamless product protection plans. Clyde’s first integration was with Shopify where they developed an onboarding process that requires no coding whatsoever. The Clyde platform will include integrations with the Shopify App Store and Magento Marketplace, as well as an API, SDK and widget, and a solution for in-store sales.</p><p> </p><p>The updates will make Clyde’s product protection solutions accessible to businesses from direct-to-consumer startups to Fortune 100 enterprises.</p><p> </p><p>“Clyde is the first mover in this space and our technology and partnerships with customers reflect that,” said co-founder and CEO, Brandon Gell. “Clyde is rethinking insurance in modern terms, and bringing features to the table that traditional insurers simply don't offer. Our new Magento extension is giving even more retailers turnkey access to Clyde, and our new suite of developer tools allows businesses, regardless of eCommerce platform, to get up and running with a minimal level of effort<strong>.”</strong></p><p> </p><p>In a survey of Clyde’s contracts sold in the electronics, equipment and jewelry categories, 21% were made by repeat customers. This allows Clyde’s retail partners to increase their sales revenue and customer lifetime value (CLV).</p><p> </p><p>Research shows that<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/" data-rt-link-type="external"> three-quarters</a> of consumers abandon their shopping carts before completing a purchase. Yet, industry trends also show customers are willing to pay more for<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-releases/2018/experience-is-everything-heres-how-to-get-it-right.html" data-rt-link-type="external"> quality experiences</a> and transparency. Clyde addresses these insights by providing customer education and product transparency for today’s retail customers. By emphasizing user experience design and driving data insights into customer loyalty as well as warranty sales, Clyde helps retailers address customers from the first sale to loyal repurchaser.</p><p> </p><p>“At the end of the day Clyde is really a no-brainer for any store owner looking to build more credibility with their brand by offering a great value add to their end customer,” said EvoGimbals CEO Peter Coughlin.</p><p> </p><p>"Clyde has been a fantastic addition to our business. The installation onto our Shopify website was easy and seamless… A shout-out to Clyde's support as all of our interactions have been overwhelmingly positive,” said Soul Ceramics owner TJ Biddle.</p><p> </p><p>The Magento extension from Clyde gives Magento partners a Shopify-like onboarding experience, immediate access to Clyde’s network of insurance partners, and an all-in-one dashboard for program management.</p><p>Ecommerce integrations don’t end there, as Clyde is set to release options for custom built sites. Clyde’s API, SDK, and widget for front-end design make access to the Clyde platform universal for websites, physical POS’s, and apps.</p><p> </p><p><strong>About Clyde</strong></p><p>Clyde is an insurance technology service provider based in New York City and focused on product protection solutions. Founded in 2017, Clyde was the first insurtech to enter the product protection market.

Not many options available to businesses can help on both of those fronts at the same time. Offering customers extended warranties is one of them.<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/extended-warranties-what-you-didnt-know">‍</a></p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/extended-warranties-what-you-didnt-know">Extended warranties</a> are a win-win because they improve things for both the buyer and the seller. Consumers can be sure that their purchase is protected from failure or accident; they gain peace of mind and feel more positively about the retailer. That helps bolster a sense of meaningfulness for retailers, who also get the boon of increased revenue on a net-new product offering that has virtual no start-up time and absolutely no start-up cost.</p><p>And <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/7-things-to-consider-for-warranty-programs">extended warranty programs</a> work in key industries:</p><h3><strong>Consumer electronics</strong></h3><p>As the <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0240-extended-warranties-and-service-contracts">FTC</a> explains, not all service contracts or <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/extended-warranties-what-you-didnt-know">extended warranties</a> are created equal. If the product is likely to need repairs, though—or if a consumer is worried about damaging it—an extended warranty can be a great purchase.&nbsp; (That’s why <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2020/02/25/apples-services-to-top-50-billion-profits-by-2025--beating-iphone/?sh=2ff54ee253db">Apple’s Services business, driven by its AppleCare</a> extended warranty offering, is the company’s highest-margin (at 63%) and second-largest segment.)</p><h3><strong>Furniture and mattresses</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-information/how-much-does-a-mattress-cost">average price for a queen-sized mattress</a>, even on the budget side of things, is $600 (with luxury mattresses averaging in at double that). A <a href="https://archive.curbed.com/2017/11/16/16635672/affordable-furniture-ikea-ashley-west-elm#:~:text=The%20average%20sofa%20in%20the,worth%20of%20materials%20in%20it.">couch comes in around $1,000</a>. Furniture isn’t cheap, and customers deserve to be protected. These major life purchases that are expected to last for 10-plus years make extended warranties an easy add-on sell: customers definitely want to make sure that their big investment will last.</p><h3><strong>Jewelry and accessories</strong></h3><p>Jewelry may not seem like a purchase that will break. Diamonds are forever, after all. But accidents have been around just as long a girl's best frined, too, and when things go wrong—when a kid yanks on a pendant or a watch suddenly stops working—customers will be glad to have the peace of mind of knowing that they’re taken care of.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Sporting goods</strong></h3><p>The sporting goods market is set to maintain its boom through 2026, says <a href="https://testmeasurement.com.au/uncategorized/65912/retail-sporting-goods-market-booming-segments-investors-seeking-growth-2021-2026/">a recent industry report</a>; individual retailers are posting <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/05/why-big-5-sporting-goods-stock-was-surging-today/">best-ever numbers</a> for 2021. Retailers can distinguish themselves from the crowd of competition by offering extended warranties so that customers know their purchases are protected long past this season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>6 Tips for Selling &amp; Managing Extended Warranties For eCommerce</h2><h3>1. Explain what’s included—and what’s not.</h3><p>Not all customers understand the differences between warranties, product protection, service contracts, and extended warranties. (Spoiler alert: some of those are the same thing, just with different names; it’s definitely confusing.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>Make sure that you’re partnering with an extended warranty provider that makes it clear to customers, in easy-to-understand terms, what’s covered. For instance, they may not know they’d be covered for breaks, repairs, and replacements both for product failure and for accidents.<br></p><p>And then take the time to <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">talk to your customers about product protection</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Give customers several options for buying warranties.</h3><p>Some customers will be ready to buy right away, even choosing certain retailers for their extended warranty options. Others won’t have considered buying purchase protection until they see an option pop up at checkout.<br></p><p>Retailers should introduce the idea of warranties early, but recognize that not everyone will buy at the same point in the process.<br></p><p>To meet customers wherever they are on the journey of protecting their purchases, make sure you have a variety of options for interacting with them along the way.<br></p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Clyde</a> customers can use on-site warranty offers on product pages, on pop-up modals as products are added to a cart, and on the checkout page itself. They can also send follow-up emails with warranty information, and include that info in a customer portal that auto-populates with their purchase history and allows them to buy coverage up to six months after purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>3. Highlight ease of use for customers.<br></h3><p>Traditional warranty programs put way too much onus on the customer to be perfectly organized. Even <a href="https://www.insurance.wa.gov/extended-warranties-service-contracts">Washington State’s Insurance Commissioner</a> warns consumers there to make sure they save their original receipts from warranty purchases. That means buyers have to maintain paper records that they then mail or fax in any time they need help with a product. At that point, even a great extended warranty that covers absolutely everything is a pain to actually use.<br></p><p>Depending on your partner, eCommerce warranties can fix a lot of those old inefficiencies. Clyde, for instance, has a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/re-introducing-hiclyde">customer portal</a> that automatically populates customers’ accounts with their product purchase history and warranty information, all in plain English, and lets them file a claim directly.&nbsp;<br></p><p>No printing, no receipts, no mailing things in, and all with real-time updates.&nbsp;</p><h3>4. Use transactional emails to your advantage.</h3><p>As mentioned above, some extended warranty providers, Clyde included, give customers the option to buy extended warranties post-purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Those kinds of emails are some of the <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">most-opened communications</a> sent by retailers, so use them wisely to deepen your relationship with your customers and drive revenue with special offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>They can help catch customers who haven’t bought warranties yet, but they can also be a vehicle to upsell new product, to drive brand loyalty and interaction, or to solicit referrals and feedback.&nbsp;</p><h3>5. Price warranties right.</h3><p>Product protection plans that cost an arm and a leg are what drive people like the fine folks at the <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0240-extended-warranties-and-service-contracts">FTC</a> to warn customers about the efficacy of extended warranties. You shouldn’t price yours such that customers are paying close to the purchase price of their original item in order to make sure that they’re covered in the case of accident or product failure. While extended warranties can be and often are some of the highest-margin products a retailer will sell, there is such a thing as too much margin.<br></p><p>You can make a profit selling warranties, and a good one—just keep in mind the customer’s ability to pay, and scale your margin with the overall cost of the purchase. Make the price clear and fair.&nbsp;</p><h3>6. Collect data and adjust.</h3><p>Which products are your customers buying extended warranties for? How many claims for repairs or replacements were filed against them? How much profit did you collect on each sale?<br></p><p>Automatic analytics, like the ones available on Clyde’s platform, give retailers the answers to all of those questions. Data on warranty sales and use can help drive improvements in marketing, product development, customer service, and pretty much every other part of your company.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>What the Future Holds for E-Commerce Extended Warranties</h2><p>Divining the future is fun, so we’ll try it here, basing our prediction on the future of eCommerce extended warranties on two trends: longer product lifetimes and consolidation.</p><p>First, consumers care more about their purchases lasting a long time because doing so is better for the environment and better for their bottom lines.&nbsp; Purchases that are protected and able to be fixed by a reputable servicer will go from being a nice-to-have to a must-have as eco-friendly and price-sensitive customers look to make more thoughtful purchases.</p><p>Second, as a whole, technology is moving towards consolidation for ease of use. It’s why people stay lifelong Apple customers even when Android technology outpaces the iPhone: the switching cost of disconnecting their photos, their notes, their contacts, and their messages across all of their devices is just too high.</p><p>It’s also why apps like Pocket (which saves articles, videos, and websites in one place for you to read later) and Mint (which integrates with all of your banking, investment, and retirement accounts to create a picture of all of your money) are so popular. Even entire industries like <a href="https://archive.curbed.com/2019/3/21/18252048/real-estate-house-flipping-zillow-ibuyer-opendoor">home flipping</a> are being consolidated into single-service platforms that allow users to find homes, secure mortgages, and make offers, all at once, cutting out realtors and bankers.</p><p>The future of eCommerce, we predict, will follow suit. Technological solutions to the annoyance of having to enter your credit card in a bunch of different websites, manage different return policies, and yes, engage with different processes for fixing or replacing things that break will fall away in favor of centralized, streamlined ways to track your purchases, their warranties, and any outstanding claims. That’s why Clyde’s customer dashboard automatically matches orders with their warranty information and provides real-time updates on claims in plain language that’s easy to understand. Over time, as customers buy more extended warranties from different realizers, they’ll be able to access all of them at once.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’d like to be part of that future, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">request a free demo of Clyde today</a>.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>	Tue May 25 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

Beautiful ones. But your customers don’t need a new couch every six months.<br></p><p>If your customers aren’t coming back to your site regularly, how can you keep in touch with them and make sure you’re top of mind when they are ready to buy another piece of furniture? How can you make sure that they had such a great experience buying from you, and felt so good about their purchase, that you’re their first choice for their next expenditure?<br></p><p>You can offer <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/extended-warranties-what-you-didnt-know">extended warranties</a>.<br></p><p>Selling eCommerce furniture warranties is a great way to nurture ongoing relationships with customers while also driving up your profit margins and making sure you can capture any lost sales from faulty products.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A win-win-win, if you will.</p><h2>Why Extended Warranties are Important to Your Furniture Business</h2><p>Per the <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0252-warranties">FTC</a>, warranties aren’t <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/businesspersons-guide-federal-warranty-law">required by law</a>, but come with most major purchases.&nbsp;</p><p>Extended warranties are additional layers of protection that consumers can buy to ensure that they’ll be covered in the event of a faulty product or even an accident. They’re layered on top of regular manufacturer warranties and can often provide customers increased peace of mind for expensive or important purchases.</p><p>Here are the ways extended warranties can help an eCommerce furniture business owner:</p><h3>Drive additional revenue&nbsp;</h3><p>Offering an extended warranty on your products adds a new stream of income to your business (and a pretty high-margin one at that). When customers buy big-ticket items and add on purchase protection, you’ll see an increase in average order value without having had to invest in new product development.<br></p><p>A good extended warranty program should be able to integrate into your checkout flow quickly, in a matter of hours or, at the most, days, giving you a fairly immediate way to boost sales and drive revenue.</p><h3>Improve customer experience&nbsp;</h3><p>Offering extended warranties gives buyers peace of mind. It’s easier to shell out for a major purchase knowing that if something goes wrong, they’re covered. And if the extended warranty partner you choose offers fast and helpful customer service, that further elevates the overall customer experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If they do have to get a product repaired or replaced, you’ll want to make sure that their experience during that process is as pleasant as possible.</p><h3>Capture lost customers</h3><p>You don’t want your products to fail, but that doesn’t change the fact that sometimes they do. When that happens—whether it’s a chair that arrives covered in nicks or a sofa bed that keeps popping out springs—you can easily lose a customer.<br></p><p>Extended warranties help secure second (and third and fourth) sales from customers who would otherwise have churned out after a product failure.</p><h3>Offer better touchpoints&nbsp;</h3><p>The average American gets 200 emails a day, which is bordering on ridiculous. It makes sense that the large majority of them never get read. But email is a key channel for communicating with clients, increasing sales, and building a brand—so how can brands stand out?<br></p><p>Transactional emails on extended warranties are the way in. As a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">touchpoint Trojan horse</a>, those emails provide value to the recipient while also giving retailers a great way to pursue sales, customer success, and community-building goals.&nbsp;</p><h2>What to Look for When Choosing a Furniture Warranty Provider</h2><p>If you’re deciding on an extended warranty partner for your furniture business, you’ll want to start by grading your options against <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/7-things-to-consider-for-warranty-programs">several key considerations</a>:<br></p><h3>Flexibility in what’s covered and experience insuring it</h3><p>Insurance providers who focus on the consumer electronics niche may not be of much help to you when it comes to securing coverage for your couches and chairs. Some partners have specific niches, so make sure that the one you choose covers all of the products you’re selling.<br></p><p>You’ll also want to make sure that the insurance provider has experience covering those types of products, including whether they have a well-developed service center network, a well-staffed customer service team, and experience with any of your competitors.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ease of use by customers</h3><p>A warranty program that your customers can’t understand or navigate won’t do you any favors. Look for a furniture warranty provider with customer-friendly language, simple terms and conditions that don’t require a law degree to decipher, and a customer portal with easy navigation.</p><h3>Ease of use by your team</h3><p>As you start offering warranties and want to fine-tune how they show up in your sales flow, you’ll want to be working with a warranty partner that makes it as easy as possible to have multiple users, to customize permissions per user, and to automatically run in the background of your site as customers make purchases.<br></p><p>Offers regular, automatic reporting and analytics dashboards are good things to look for, too. You’ll want insight into, at a minimum, key metrics like contracts sold, product value covered, contract revenue earned, and profit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Branding options</h3><p>You’ll want to make it clear to buyers that your extended warranty program is something offered by your business and that protects their purchases. Look for customizable call-to-actions and branding opportunities to add your logo, color scheme, font, and brand voice to the warranty program so that it integrates cleanly into your site.</p><h3>Projected revenue</h3><p>Ask any extended warranty partner you’re considering working with how much revenue you can expect in a finite time period after starting to work with them, and see what they say. You’ll want to make sure that they’re experienced with revenue planning and can walk you through the direct and indirect revenue effects of their program.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For instance, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101eunXCkW8Z9Co6exCdNgqprHHPPVB1Jd3KDP-GTSlA/edit?usp=sharing">here’s a free Clyde revenue worksheet</a> that does just that.</p><h2>5 Tips for Selling &amp; Managing Furniture Warranties Through Your Website</h2><p>To make the most of your furniture website’s extended warranty program, make sure you:</p><ol><li>Use CTAs at different points in the purchase process</li></ol><p>Offering a new on-site service requires some experimentation, so make sure you try different methods of letting customers know what their options are.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For instance, Clyde customers can try on-site options on product pages, on modals that pop-up after products are added to a cart, or on the cart page itself. Many businesses find the most success with integrating co-branded CTAs in all three places.</p><ol start="2"><li>Optimize pricing</li></ol><p>You’ll want to adjust your margin so that you can find the price point that works best for both your customers and your business.<br></p><p>Clyde’s customers can use the Autopilot Margins feature to automatically adjust your margin based on price sensitivity and attachment rate in order to drive more revenue.<br></p><ol start="3"><li>Take advantage of post-purchase communication</li></ol><p>Transaction emails, like order confirmations and extended warranty options, are opened more than other emails, so they’re a great way to build customer loyalty by providing something valuable but also branded.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Work with your warranty provider to send helpful and accurate warranty information in post-purchase emails that can be combined with upsell opportunities.<br></p><ol start="4"><li>Review warranty insights regularly</li></ol><p>Whether your warranty provider comes with regular customer service reps, online analytics, or both, make sure you’re reviewing insights about how your program is performing. That data can help drive product improvements as well as help you hone in on what products your customers value most, which are those products that they’re most interested in protecting, and at what price point, which can help you with marketing as well as new product development.</p><ol start="5"><li>A/B test your offerings</li></ol><p>Once you’ve got a few weeks’ worth of data under your belt, use those insights to run targeted experiments on pricing, CTA language and positioning, and branding to see if you can find an even higher attachment rate.<br></p><p>Each company will be different, but the Clyde team has seen attachment rates jump up three, four, or even ten times what they were previously, depending on how CTAs are activated and designed.<br></p><h2>What The Future Holds for eCommerce Furniture Warranties</h2><p>Furniture has seen a boom season over the last year, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/08/furniture-sales-pandemic/">per the <em>Washington Post</em></a>, as people have been stuck inside and have decided to invest in their space. La-Z-Boy, for instance, is still five to nine months behind fulfilling orders, and Overstock.com saw sales surge by 75% last year, driven in part by spikes in demand for home furnishings.<br></p><p>As work-from-home arrangements become permanent and customers continue to look for ways to upgrade their homes, high demand is likely to continue. Retailers who want to distinguish themselves and build long-term customer loyalty will be looking for ways to set themselves apart, including by offering comprehensive extended warranty programs that are easy to use and give customers peace of mind in case anything happens to their major furniture purchases.</p><p><br>Clyde’s fully-managed service and global network of best-in-class insurers is ready to meet that boom. <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Request a demo</a> today to see how an extended warranty partner could help drive revenue and improve customer experience within minutes of integration.</p>	Thu May 13 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

The first step to creating these network effects is to get people purchasing your product and then encouraging them to openly admit those purchases.&nbsp;</p><h1 data-w-id="774ab24d-060b-836f-5fdc-ce9c2cf2443e">Improvements on the cheap</h1><p data-w-id="9966ee38-3b9c-d582-8cc0-de1c799d9939">Luckily for retailers who want to improve customer experience, many of the factors above can be accounted for with a new prioritization of effort, and not necessarily more money.

Brand reviews from external sites and press also go a long way toward establishing trust. If you don’t have access to a publicist, building a strong following on social media is also a powerful way to show trustworthiness to consumers. Product ratings and the ability to write reviews on product pages is another strong indicator of product quality.

Tech Tailwinds: An Executive Summary	tech-tailwinds-an-executive-summary	Tech Tailwinds: An Executive Summary Of Our Whitepaper	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61e1c4d05cb2c67d59ac3bd4_TECH-TAILWINDS-04%20(1).png	<p>Our latest whitepaper, <a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/WP-TechTailwinds.html">Tech Tailwinds</a>, tackles the topic of what it would take to cultivate a cashflow-positive tech stack. For your convience we've broken out a few of the major themes below in bite-size form. If you'd like read the whitepaper and the full interviews we conducted on the subject, <a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/WP-TechTailwinds.html">click here</a> or on the whitepaper graphic below. </p><h3>The Buy vs. Build Debate Is Over<br></h3><p>A 2020 SaaS trend report published by Blissfully found that the average mid-market company (101-1,000 employees) uses 185 apps, while an enterprise company (1,000+ employees) uses 288. The usage of applications and third-party technologies has ballooned by 50% in the last three years alone. The sheer resources necessary to keep up with these technical needs from an “in-house” perspective is staggering. That’s why companies have raised the white flag and sought out outside vendors at nearly every turn. <br></p><p>But the shift to buying technology isn’t purely a question of internal resources and budget, it also extends to the realization that you can’t be an expert in everything. Michael Bloom, the Director of Digital Development at Techtronic Industries, puts it like this:<br></p><p><em>In the end, we’re not experts in everything. For example, we have an extended warranty program that we’ve outsourced to Clyde because we don’t have the expertise in that field to make a top-class product in-house. And by working with them, we can leverage their expertise moving forward. Even if we were able to make it all work in-house, we would never have their expertise to continually improve the product. </em><br></p><p>Companies like Clyde have a vested interest in improving their product through innovation, an imperative that an in-house solution simply wouldn’t have in the same way.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1008px"><a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/WP-TechTailwinds.html" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61ddf8604096bd45fafd1d08_Tech%20Tailwinds.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>Is your tech stack still a financial anchor that is only viewed as a line item, a mere cost of doing business? What if you could create a cashflow-positive tech stack? What kinds of opportunities would that open up for your business? Learn more <a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/WP-TechTailwinds.html">here</a>.</figcaption></figure><h3>A Hub For eCommerce <br></h3><p>Our CEO, Brandon Gell, believes a centralized hub in which all your technologies can work in concert with one another is critical. <br></p><p>Clyde’s proprietary technology allows it to sync customer data with our merchants’ data in real-time. But that data has limited potential if it’s siloed in individual apps. Within the new Clyde hub, companies can utilize dozens of apps ranging from software designed to optimize post-purchase email campaigns, to leading buy now, pay later providers. Through an open API, these technology integrations can work together in one place, making it easier to spot duplicative services and waste, while streamlining and optimizing a merchant’s operations. <br></p><p>The monetary and efficiency gains that be can experienced by utilizing this hub can help finance more competitive prices and new product lines, while bolstering customer service and support operations. <br></p><h3>An eComm Hack: Partnerships &amp; Integrations<br></h3><p>To quote Harrison Forman, a former Facebook manager in Media Partnerships, “if you don’t connect your core product to all the other tools your customers are using, frankly you’re a dinosaur.”<br></p><p>When partnerships are forged and integrations flow seamlessly between &nbsp;separate technologies, a host of positive outcomes reveal themselves. The revenue sharing, co-selling, co-managing, and data opportunities alone illustrate why tech companies are investing more and more into their partnership teams.

A/B Testing Product Protection for Great Customer Experience	testing-product-protection-for-cx	A/B Testing Product Protection for Great Customer Experience	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5d2f36613c08731af4e0680b_Protection%20Plan%20Testing%20Header.85.png	<p data-w-id="77d8502d-df60-4354-0fff-9c4b381c0bd9">In today’s technology landscape, every new initiative requires some testing and tweaking in order to achieve acceptable levels of performance. Without the ability to test, the only alternative is to accept the status quo and make guesses at how to improve performance, which is pretty difficult unless you have a crystal ball. Testing helps businesses understand which decisions work and which ones need improvement.<br data-w-id="a91d7f43-4bec-3042-8b3d-f10ee92dad22"></p><p data-w-id="8bae6452-d769-8812-9027-abfbf4d584a0">All that might seem obvious, but for the last&nbsp; <a data-w-id="7a54eb6a-9c0e-3450-3d55-a1bdce921afb" href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/brief-history-of-product-protection" data-rt-link-type="external">100 years</a> testing hasn’t been possible with extended warranties or product protection. Most extended warranty providers send spreadsheets and static rates to retailers. Those providers then ask the <em data-w-id="5c56d46a-64b5-850d-2367-b52ce2be7dc1">retailer</em> to build technology to manage their program or use manual processes to conduct business (hey there, Excel!). This causes a technical dependance that forces internal IT departments or operations teams to take on the burden of making changes and managing process. Depending on the organization, either of these tasks take weeks or months to complete. That size and effort of work usually means that tests get deprioritized to simply get the new initiative up and running. Because of this, most companies who accomplish the massive feat of building an extended warranty program end up running the same program for years on end with little to no opportunity for change or improvement.<br data-w-id="ce590326-1aed-2f29-9db3-1abfc958977b"></p><p data-w-id="20f11af5-62eb-c4d1-3f75-be0c40bf834e">Clyde gives companies big and small the ability not only to offer extended warranties but also to optimize them.

Clyde presents retailers with a fixed cost for each type of extended warranty they can sell. Just like any other inventory, retailers can then markup the extended warranties to earn a profit on each transaction, as well as increasing their average order value. Clyde offers retailers the ability to change the markup of products whenever they would like. While we wouldn’t suggest doing this frequently, testing different pricing can provide better results. As part of the on-boarding process with Clyde, you’ll receive guided sessions with one of our very own data scientists to help identify actionable next steps for your business.</p><h2 data-w-id="43dc9556-6202-b738-8e0f-e8402ea33e54"><strong data-w-id="72a6bde0-3e59-3e3d-6472-49acc3e47f87">A Real Life Example of A/B Testing</strong></h2><p data-w-id="bab8e6d3-bc21-db84-6ead-dd5cb5b149c5">We have seen customers use the flexibility of Clyde’s multiple CTAs&nbsp; to test and adjust how their extended warranty is offered. Recently a DTC retailer specializing in headphones and personal audio equipment implemented Clyde choosing only to activate the cart and product display page CTAs. After launch, they were initially seeing a 5.6% contract attachment rate (the number of orders on their site with an extended warranty attached to the purchase where the product was eligible). After their guided session with our data scientist, this company saw their attachment rate jump to nearly 50% - well above the industry 2-4% average! At Clyde, we have a portfolio of similar examples where retailers are able to make changes to their settings after a few months of data to improve performance.<br data-w-id="944fd21b-9e80-d2d8-3402-11669e4b8fb2"></p><p data-w-id="f25fc924-9d7d-ae36-ea53-f0b9874e4655">Make sure to give yourself the ability to try new approaches to your work - extended warranties and product protection for your customers are no exception. You shouldn’t have to wait for better results and neither should your customers. Do it yourself and save your more complicated, time-sensitive asks for internal IT - they might even send you a thank you note.<br data-w-id="c9a54d15-6d7a-a2e9-478a-5a7f6ffaa8ec"></p>	Wed Jul 17 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	david-dubow
The 5 Coolest Things We Saw at CES	the-5-coolest-things-we-saw-at-ces	The 5 Coolest Things We Saw at CES	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e1e39dc1533353520affae4_CES%20image.png	<p>Last week, Team Clyde headed to Las Vegas to attend the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and to hit the craps tables (just kidding, kind of).&nbsp;<br></p><p>CES is one of the largest conferences in the world. With more than 4,400 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.9 million net square feet, CES 2019 attracted 307 of the 2018 Fortune Global 500 companies. More than 175,000 industry professionals, including more than 61,000 from outside the U.S., convened in Las Vegas to drive the ever-evolving global technology industry forward.<br></p><p>In between meetings with customers and prospects, we saw some pretty amazing technological innovations. I surveyed the team to get their thoughts on the top five coolest things we saw.</p><p><br></p><h2>1. The Hyundai/Uber drone<br></h2><p>Uber and Hyundai announced a partnership to develop air taxis for a future arial rideshare network. The drone will be 100% electric, and will require five to seven minutes for recharging. It’s designed to take off and land vertically and holds up to four passengers. Don’t get too excited yet though—the flying taxi is slated to be released in 2030.</p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1240px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e1e3a6acbc13ed4497a73fa_drone.jpg"></div></figure><p>‍</p><h2>2. The Avatar/Mercedes concept car<br></h2><p>Right around the corner from the Uber/Hyundai drone, Mercedes-Ben unveiled their Vision AVTR, a concept car inspired by the 2009 film Avatar. The rear of the car is covered in 33 scales, which are meant to help passengers communicate with people outside the car.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The Vision AVTR is meant to showcase what the cars of the future may be like. The car, like most cars we saw at CES, is autonomous, and the wheels (which were inspired by the “seeds of the Tree of Souls” from the film) can rotate so that the car can move sideways and diagonally.<br></p><p>Sadly there were no James Cameron sightings (though he did help to design the car).<a href="https://www.tripp.com/subscription/frequently-asked-questions/">‍</a></p><p>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2560px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e1e3aa0cbc13e29de7a9d1d_avatarcar.jpg"></div></figure><h2>3. Tripp&nbsp;<br></h2><p>As someone who thought she was incapable of meditating, I may now be a convert thanks to virtual reality (VR) headsets and <a href="https://www.tripp.com/subscription/frequently-asked-questions/">Tripp</a>. Tripp is a VR software that helps you find calm, focus, and develop emotional resilience. The company calls it “fitness for your inner self.” On average, Tripp users report a 27% mood lift after each session (which only takes a few minutes to complete). Tripp’s software is available on Oculus Go and Oculus Quest. Namaste.</p><p><br></p><h2>4. LG’s 8K OLED TV<br></h2><p>We saw a fair number of screens at CES, but the 8K OLED displays were definitely the most impressive. From any vantage point, the displays were startlingly crisp and clear. The TV uses artificial intelligence to continuously enhance picture quality. For those eager to get their hands (eyes?) on one, they will be available on <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled88zxpua-signature-oled-8k-tv">LG’s website</a> soon.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>5. Keurig’s Drinkworks Home Bar<br></h2><p>Drinkworks is like a Keurig coffee maker, but for cocktails. Each pod contains pre-measured ingredients that when mixed with water, create a perfect individual cocktail. The representative we spoke to mentioned that they’re especially useful for people who enjoy throwing dinner parties, and want to be able to offer an array of drink options to their guests. While I was skeptical that the drinks wouldn’t be overly saccharine, I was pleasantly surprised. We tried a delicious Moscow mule and a classic margarita.</p><p>All in all, it was a great week catching up with Clyde's customers and meeting new consumer electronics companies. Hope to catch you all at the craps table next year. <br></p>	Wed Jan 15 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	maddie-buras
The Anatomy Of A Post Purchase Email	the-anatomy-of-a-post-purchase-email	The Anatomy Of A Post Purchase Email	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6182ceebab3647033f76a232_Post%20Purchase%20Warranty%20Emails.jpg	<p>Post-purchase email campaigns are vital to the overall health of an eCommerce retailer. When executed properly, these email campaigns can help drive future revenue and collect invaluable feedback from customers, all while increasing brand awareness and customer loyalty.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Delighting your customers with post-purchase emails, while nudging them towards future purchases, is a delicate balance that requires a well-calibrated strategy. This list of suggestions has been sourced through highly-credited third-party research, conversations with our top-performing merchants, and internal expertise here at Clyde.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s have a look at some of the techniques and strategies that are driving successful post-purchase campaigns today.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Transactional Emails</strong><br></h3><p>The average American consumer now receives over 200 emails per day. And as the average daily email volume has risen, open rates have fallen and more than 50% of US-based email users cite spam as a significant problem.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A Twilio study from last year found that 94% of consumers said that they’re “currently annoyed with marketing messages they receive.” As a result, the average consumer has his or her guard up when it comes to digital outreach. And that’s problematic because these digital touchpoints are vital to turning potential consumers into buyers and current customers into repeat customers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This decline in email response rates and the subsequent challenge to retailers isn’t new. In fact, Facebook co-founder and famed engineer Dustin Moskovitz predicted we were headed for “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/01/next-big-thing-missed-facebook-co-founder-says-email/">peak email</a>” all the way back in 2014. There has been a steady decline in open and click-through rates related to emails since the early 2010s and, as a result, nearly every type of email has suffered, with the exception of transactional emails.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A study by MarketingSherpa found that consumers read transactional emails over 60% of the time, making them nearly three times more likely to be read than emails centered around promotions and sales.&nbsp;<br></p><p>At Clyde, our partners report open rates in excess of 78% when email subject lines are related to their warranty or protection plans. And by the nature of most contracts being offered in one, two, and three-year increments, this creates meaningful touchpoints at the point of sale and at yearly checkpoints. Those “<a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/anniversary-email-examples">anniversary</a>” emails allow you to tap into personalized data that has the potential to cut through email inbox noise.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As for transactional emails that you can use to reach customers post-purchase, here are the four most useful:<br></p><h5><strong>Order Confirmation | Shipment Tracking Alerts</strong></h5><h5><strong>Thank You | Feedback (With Incentives)</strong><br></h5><p>Open rates for order confirmations and shipping updates outpace any other email type by a large margin. But thank you emails, triggered when items have been delivered, and feedback surveys that are properly incentivized have also proven to be useful for merchants hoping to engage with their customers post-purchase. According to data from <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/blog/post-purchase-emails">Klaviyo</a>, thank you emails can have a 352 percent higher open rate than a traditional email campaign and a 329 percent higher click-through rate (CTR), because customers are expecting emails after paying for their orders.<br></p><p>Automating these four types to work in conjunction with one another is the foundation that all successful post-purchase campaigns are built upon.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Customize Based On Behavior</strong><br></h3><p>Once you’ve created a generic email campaign for all customers in a post-purchase environment, it’s time to customize the experience. By harnessing the power of your data, it’s possible to catalog your customers by their spending habits and, in some cases, when and where they click.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:33%"><a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/rs/558-KXS-517/images/ClydePostPurchasePlaybook.pdf" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6182cfc8490ed219b73d39bc_Post%20Purchase%20Playbook.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>Click on our playbook above to unlock the best practices currently being employed by leading eCommerce merchants.</figcaption></figure><p>As it relates to protection plans and warranties, Clyde has been able to utilize click-by-click data to create user experiences geared towards conversion. The location of cart, modal/pop-up, and product page buttons significantly impacts a customer’s likelihood to attach a protection plan to their purchase. By collecting this data, we also know where customers “abandoned” a specific purchase. Knowing where a customer exited the purchasing journey is critical to crafting a post-purchase email tailored specifically to them.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Overall spending habits are also a great metric to consider when customizing a campaign. Spending data helps brands create dynamic product recommendations. It can also be the statistical backbone for a rewards program. Needless to say, the data that you already have about your customers’ habits should drive a significant portion of your post-purchase email campaign.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Calibrate Email Frequency&nbsp;</strong><br></h3><p>The key here is to avoid email fatigue. Between transactional emails and product recommendations, you can be sending north of 10 emails to a single customer in a short period of time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can combat email fatigue by observing your engagement metrics. Check your open, click-through, and unsubscribe rates to spot any fluctuations in activity. Experiment with delaying general email campaigns until after a customer receives their post-purchase emails.<br></p><h3><strong>Run Tests To Optimize</strong><br></h3><p>Running routine tests to optimize your campaigns is a vital business practice that can help you in both the short and long term. Not only can it drive short-term conversion, but it is also an essential process to learn what kind of messaging resonates with your audience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Don’t be afraid to run multiple tests to refine your post-purchase email campaigns. It’s only by analyzing the data that you can connect directly with your audience while giving your sales a shot in the arm.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Elements that can easily be tested include:<br></p><h5><strong>Subject Lines | Preheaders | Call To Action</strong></h5><h5><strong>Day/Time of Send| Multimedia Usage| Personalization</strong><br></h5><p>Subject lines and the preview text presented on most smartphones (preheaders) are usually the top two optimization levers considered by merchants sending emails. But the rest of the list can be equally useful. Through optimization CTAs, personalization choices and multimedia usage can be refined over time to elicit prescribed responses from recipients.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Whether you test one element of your email campaign or the full battery of customizable options, it’s important to remember that optimization is an on-going process that is never completely finished. By cataloging your data properly you can be ready to alter your email campaigns at a moment’s notice based upon trends and consumer preferences.<br></p>	Wed Nov 03 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

I kept stopping to look at window displays, pop in to try something, or check out a deal.</p><p>That was pre-pandemic, though, and I wouldn’t have that same experience today.</p><p>A <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2021/02/04/one-year-into-pandemic-fifth-avenue-blighted-by-empty-stores/">quarter of all Fifth Avenue storefronts are shuttered</a>, and while some will come back (especially as rents drop by as much as 40%), shopping may never look the same. And it’s more than just luxury retail: as brick-and-mortar stores closed because of the pandemic, e-commerce’s meteoric <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-ecommerce-by-category-2020">growth includes spikes in</a> household essentials, food and beverage, personal care and beauty, books and media, toys and hobby, jewelry, and consumer electronics.</p><p>But while permanent storefronts might not look as appealing to retailers, that doesn’t mean vendors—both traditional and non—won’t have any physical presence.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it’s established brands looking to connect with Gen Z buyers, successful e-commerce sellers wanting to build brand awareness, niche creators interested in building on-the-ground community, or retailers of all sizes hoping to experiment with new markets, products, and trends without committing to a multi-year lease, temporary in-person shopping experiences have a lot to offer.</p><p>We’re calling it now: the pop-up renaissance is coming.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What’s a pop-up? + 8 pop-up examples</strong></h2><p>A pop-up is a retail store or experience opened temporarily, often in a makeshift space, by a company or brand in order to do one or more of the following:</p><ul><li>Meet seasonal demand</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/25/18023130/spirit-halloween-party-city-pop-up-stores">Spirit Halloween is the ultimate seasonal pop-up</a>, showing up in early fall like clockwork and disappearing again right as November hits.

Many pop-ups are marketed to a select group of consumers, like influencers and brand loyalists, to encourage their attendance and participation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Scarcity</strong>. Usually only open for a short run, pop-ups enjoy the demand surges that come with a limited-time opportunity.</li><li><strong>Hyper-personalized</strong>. Often designed around a target audience, pop-ups can appeal to specific subsections of desired consumers, from Gen Z buyers to LA bloggers to Chicago dog owners.</li></ul><h2><strong>Where did pop-ups come from?</strong></h2><p>If you look back far enough, you can find the first seasonal pop-ups in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/nov/29/a-brief-history-of-christmas-markets">13th-century Christmas markets</a> that started in Vienna and spread out across Europe, where vendors sold seasonable treats and crafts.&nbsp;</p><p>Later centuries saw pop-ups that were set out to drive sales or reach new customers, from 18th-century book peddlers who sold tomes out of their carts to 20th century “<a href="https://time.com/4344621/history-rolling-store/">rolling stones</a>,” which were trucks or buses that would drive into town to sell clothing, foodstuffs, school supplies, and other goods before heading on to the next location. Farmers’ markets and music festivals are other examples of well-known pop-ups that have now become a part of regular commerce.</p><p>The Ritual Expo, first held in 1997, was one of the first modern pop-up stores that sought to sell goods, create brand awareness, play into consumer trends, and build community all at once. A <a href="https://www.just-style.com/news/ritual-expo-launches-fashion-art-and-music-tour_id76584.aspx">2000 press release</a> called that year’s Expo “an opportunity to soak up a unique environment while shopping for hard-to-find, cutting-edge merchandise” with “a chance to test AT&amp;T Wireless’ cutting-edge technology and see the latest fashion accessories for wireless phones” along with “progresive fashion, art, and photo exhibits, live music, artists, DJ culture and web life.”&nbsp;</p><p>Pop-ups have played pivotal roles in growing certain industries, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Restaurants</strong>. Like with traditional retail pop-ups, chefs often host pop-up dining events to reach a new audience, test-run restaurant ideas, or create buzz. (<a href="https://www.neworleans.com/blog/post/new-orleans-best-pop-up-restaurants/">Here’s</a> a list of hot pop-up restaurants in New Orleans, for example.)</li><li><strong>Jewelry</strong>. Accessories tend to be a cyclical business, with peaks around holidays like Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and Mother’s day. Jewelers have had success launching pop-up shops or events in the lead-up to holiday season, from <a href="https://mejuri.com/info/piercing-studio-la">Mejuri’s pop-up piercing studio in LA</a> to <a href="https://milled.com/alison-lou/nyc-pop-up-now-open-1QljPqCNFNK7SkyZ">Alison Lui’s holiday pop-up in NYC</a>.</li><li><strong>Media</strong>. From <a href="http://gameofthronesexhibition.com/"><em>Game of Thrones</em>-themed traveling exhibitions</a> to the <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/lukes-diner-gilmore-girls-pop-up">200 Luke’s Diners lookalikes</a> that Netflix sponsored across the U.S. to support their <em>Gilmore Girls </em>reboot, there’s no shortage of ways to deploy pop-up tactics in order to drive awareness of shows, movies, and music.</li></ul><h2><strong>Welcome to the renaissance of pop-ups&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Even before the pandemic, online-only brands were experimenting with building community in new ways via pop-ups. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kaleighmoore/2020/02/20/why-outdoor-retailers-like-backcountry-are-testing-physical-retail-spaces-in-soho/?sh=6ca8195c3f6c">This <em>Forbes</em> piece</a> on outdoor retailers popping up in New York City quotes e-commerce brand Backcountry’s SVP of marketing as saying, “SoHo offered us the opportunity to jump into the deep end of retail: The customers are discerning and have incredibly high expectations, your neighbors are considered some of the best in retail, and the market is crowded—so you have to stand out.”</p><p>Backcountry’s pop-up was successful, the piece goes on to say, citing collaborations with partner brands, well-attended events, and a clear spike in sales, with AOV for online orders placed in-store ringing in at twice as high as AOV on the site.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming out of a year-long COVID-19 shutdown that has scared retailers away from long-term leases, added competition to the e-comm space, and seen some newer brands develop real customer loyalty, it’s pop-ups’ time to shine.</p><p>Here are some ideas we expect to see retailers, both traditional and non-, jump on in the pop-up space:</p><ul><li>Big box stores planning their physical footprint differently, collaborating with competitors to share space in more flexible leasing arrangements and designs</li><li>Sellers building hype around special product launches and drops by planning pop-up parties (either one-offs or nationwide campaigns), especially for products targeted at novelty-loving Gen Z</li><li>Crossover pop-ups uniting different industries, like a workout gear company partnering with a food brand to launch a co-branded shop / cafe to build off of each other’s complementary audiences</li><li>Number-crunching e-comm marketplaces using buying trend data to host hyper-personalized holiday shopping markets, either in standalone pop-ups or within a network of existing stores, around key shopping periods like Mother’s Day and Christmas</li><li>Subscription services investing in pop-ups (a la Birchbox, as explained above) to bring their products to a new market</li><li>Media companies leveraging pop-ups to build hype for new releases. from music to movies</li><li>A full embrace of the outdoors, with open-walled shipping containers just being the start, especially as people are wary about things like ventilation in indoor spaces</li><li>Tech-powered installations, like murals with embedded QR codes, functioning as a kind of pop-up/street art hybrid</li><li>And more and more designed-for-Instagram pop-ups like 29 Rooms to create troves of user-generated content to use in social media marketing and beyond</li></ul><h2><strong>6 rules for approaching pop-ups as a retailer</strong></h2><p>So you agree: we’re in a pop-up renaissance. What does that mean for your business?</p><p>We asked Sarah Shaprio, Head of Digital Merchandising, DTC at Clorox and Founder at <a href="http://rosiebold.com/">Rosie Bold</a>, an accessories line for kids to empower girls to be bold (as well as a <a href="https://www.shapiroventures.com/retail">retail consultant</a> and the author of the weekly retail round-up <a href="http://www.sarah-shapiro.com/newsletter-signup">Sarah’s Retail Diary</a>), to weigh in.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are her rules for brands considering exploring the space:</p><h3><strong>1. Think of it as a test.</strong></h3><p>“A retailer who hasn't dipped their toes in brick and mortar yet should think about it more in terms of a marketing and acquisition test,” says Sarah. “Don't be afraid to try something new and get new potential customers familiar with their brand. You want them to have a great impression versus trying to push hard on sales at first. Testing is the best way to approach it.”<strong>‍</strong></p><h3><strong>2. Don’t chase every opportunity—find the right one.</strong></h3><p>Yes, we’ve done all this work to convince you that pop-ups are the greatest thing to hit retail since the online shopping cart, but don’t rush into launching a pop-up that doesn’t make sense, says Sarah. “Is the opportunity a good fit? If it doesn't make immediate sense to you, think about how confusing it will be to others,” she says. That means understanding the point-in-time goals as well as thinking about your larger brand experience. “Think about the long-tail opportunities and what you can do next to continue the excitement.”</p><h3><strong>3. Identify the exact audience you’re serving.</strong></h3><p>“With a pop-up you can also think hyper local. What community will you be able to serve and how can you connect with them. Can you make it a super special brand experience?” she adds.</p><h3><strong>4. If you’re not Nike, that’s okay.</strong></h3><p>Ostentatious isn’t always right for your goals or your budget, says Sarah. “For a pop-up, brands need to be focused on their own brand vs trying to do the same thing as someone else. It doesn't have to be a huge splash, something simple can be meaningful.”</p><h3><strong>5. Consider partners or themes.</strong></h3><p>You don’t have to go it alone. “A potter can partner with a plant store to do a pop-up—two products that don't compete but have such a strong affinity. A jewelry boutique or brand can do an ear piercing party,” says Sarah.</p><h3><strong>6. Get inspired!</strong></h3><p>Sarah’s located in California, but says that she can’t wait to visit the <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/ltd-lizzie-tisch-bringing-fresh-213829706.html">LTD by Lizzie Tisch </a>&nbsp;pop-up when it’s safe to travel. She also loves what <a href="https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/pop-in-olivia-kim?campaign=0319popinushp&jid=j012253-14996&cm_sp=merch-_-olivia_kim_14996_j012253-_-hp_pop-in_p99_guide&">Olivia Kim executes at Nordstrom's with the Pop-In</a> and their focused assortments (currently curated on the theme “Package Free for Earth Day”). “Being able to learn about new brands and a special unique experience that you can only discover at a pop-up is the best to me,” she adds.

The Art of the Pop-Up, Redux: Insight from The Pop Up Shop Agency’s Hope Newman	the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman	The Art of the Pop-Up, Redux: Insight from The Pop Up Shop Agency’s Hope Newman	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60e72910b6735b81de3bd387_Net%20Promoter%20Artwork%203.jpg	<p>Successful business growth used to look like this: little store does well, sees sales goes up, expands into other locations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You know the time lapse I’m talking about, where we start with one location in one state and then see dozens more pop up across the country until we’ve got a full-fledged national brand on our hands.&nbsp;<br></p><p>eCommerce came along and broke a lot of those norms. While some brands do expand into physical retail after strong online sales, like Casper with its sleep stores and Amazon’s various retail experiments from four-star-and-up marketplaces to cashierless checkouts, retail is no longer the end-all, be-all arbiter of commercial success. Even those brands are using retail not just to drive sales but also to test out new products and service offerings, build brand awareness, and earn media mentions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For many expanding eCommerce brands with those goals, permanent retail space isn’t necessarily the right next step. That’s especially true post-pandemic, when sellers of all stripes are nervous about signing up for long-term physical commitments. Per <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/landlord-tenant--leases/1074126/adaptation-of-commercial-real-estate-in-a-post-pandemic-world-">a recent report on commercial real estate</a>, office availability in NYC hit 16.1% in the first quarter of 2021, the highest number on record. A <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/lexis-practical-guidance/the-journal/b/pa/posts/survey-of-commercial-lease-terms-reveals-ongoing-covid-19-implications">survey of commercial lessees</a> found that 47% of them had put lease negotiations on hold or pulled out of leases during the pandemic.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With an omnichannel strategy looking like the future of successful commerce and permanent retail spaces requiring too much commitment, how can growing eCommerce companies increase their visibility in a crowded market?<br></p><p>We surveyed experts in the field and have four answers for you. We’ll address the first in this piece, and the others will follow as part of our series, <strong>Growth Reimagined: eComm Strategies That Work, No Lease Required</strong>.</p><p><br></p><ol><li><strong>The Art of the Pop-Up, Redux</strong></li><li>The Future of Influencer Marketing Is Here</li><li>Meet You at the (Virtual) Mall: An Intro to Social Shopping</li><li>Expos and Trade Shows Are Back—We’ll See You There<br></li></ol><h2>eComm is popping</h2><p>When I first reached out to Hope Newman to set up an interview for this piece, she got back to me with a phone call.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Outlook is down, we have so many emails coming in!” Hope explained. She’s the Creative Director of <a href="https://www.popupshopagency.com/">The Pop Up Shop Agency</a>, a marketing consultancy that does exactly what its name implies. The agency has created immersive, pop-up shops and experiences for brands like Bose, HBO, and Puma, among others. And now Hope is seeing her inbox (when it’s working) fill up with outreach from a new type of client: eCommerce brands.<br></p><p>“<strong>eCommerce companies are the main ones contacting us right now</strong>. They spent a year having incredible success, and they want to expand, and they have more cash to do so,” says Hope. The spike in eComm interest has more than made up for a downtick in demand from consumer package brands or brick and mortar establishments looking to generate more dramatic content, she adds.</p><h2>What eComm brands are looking for—and what they <em>should</em> be looking for</h2><p>The booking form on The Pop Up Shop Agency’s website lists off a variety of goals that brands may have for their pop-up events:<br></p><ul><li>Sales</li><li>New product introduction</li><li>Brand promotion</li><li>PR exposure</li><li>Research and feedback<br></li></ul><p>“Almost all [eComm brands we work with] just think cash, pop-ups as a way to generate more money,” says Hope. “<strong>The smarter ones realize it’s a content play as well</strong>.”<br></p><p>That content comes in two waves, says Hope. First, there’s brand-created content to help convert a casual consumer into a brand ambassador.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“As a content generator for brand awareness, [pop-ups] are way, way more effective than a TikTok video,” she says. “You generate 360 degree, immerse engagement; you have a person in front of you and can envelop them in your brand with all five senses. Once you get them to the door, or to the activation, you can have a true conversion.”<br></p><p>The second wave of content is user-generated content (UGC), or content made by participants and shared on their own social media channels, which brands can later build into marketing campaigns.<br></p><p>She points to a few key metrics that measure a pop-up’s success along both waves of content as well as more traditional sales:<br></p><ul><li>Sales per square foot</li><li>Social media following</li><li>Social media engagement (tags, likes, shares)</li><li>Site traffic numbers</li></ul><h2>The growth path for a pop-up</h2><p>While pop-ups are, by Hope’s definition, “anything that does not last,” a pop-up doesn’t necessarily have to fade out into nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Some pop-ups are pure PR. They’re not looking to run retail numbers; they’re purely brand awareness plays,” she says.<br></p><p>But sometimes, in the process of running a pop-up, brands discover that there’s sustainable demand for that presence.<br></p><p>I bring up the example of the Mejuri flagship store in NoLita. I’d walked by it a few days before interviewing Hope and I was shocked at the long line of masked-up shoppers waiting to get into the store.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://mejuri.com/">Mejuri</a> started as a Canadian-based fine jewelry eCommerce site. It found success by ignoring traditional jewelry marketing, which targeted men who were buying for the women in their lives, and instead inviting women to invest in quality—but still affordable—jewelry to celebrate themselves. Per <a href="https://fashionmagazine.com/style/mejuri-opens-location-new-york/#:~:text=Mejuri%20has%20grown%20exponentially%20since,choice%20for%20a%20second%20location"><em>Fashion</em></a>, they grew 400% year-over-year from 2015 to 2018, leading them to open a short-term first location in Toronto.<br></p><p>Customers loved the option to try on the jewelry in store, as well as to experience the luxury the brand promised, from sleek couches and velvet chairs to gilded mirrors and jewelry concierges to help them find their ideal pieces. The Toronto location became a permanent one, and the brand decided to expand into a <a href="https://mejuri.com/locations/new-york">New York shop</a>, once again starting with a showroom but extending it into a permanent flagship when it proved successful. The New York store also experiments with new products and with customer activation.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60e7255aee3815205956caff_z-MY7dhihv8IvBzg6YFQnsyu_NULgYRU8SFl_Pk-sMrCqf44fMeAiMOUM8Sxn3P6eE0VPZ1K8MwmdvuvZiPeH1K8Ctm-OszDJw0YAWXgc78mIpVRj_pfSteKSBX7r7HZ_wVR-oIc.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>“That happens all the time,” says Hope of Mejuri’s journey. “We have a client right now who’s an eComm brand thinking of doing their first store in the US. They’re going to start with one in Brooklyn. They want us to look for spaces where we can do a three-month pop-up test, since they’ve never done brick and mortar, but also to speak to the landlords and see if they’d be willing to extend the lease longer. They’re pre-planning that they could permanently stay in that space.”<br></p><p>Hope says she’s seen clients who will do 12 pop-ups all across the States and find that one or two of them are successful enough to merit a full-time, more permanent location. “That’s why pop-ups work as a business—you can test certain locations,” says Hope.&nbsp;</p><h2>The future of eComm pop-ups</h2><p>Hope sees three trends emerging when it comes to how eComm companies are taking advantage of the marketing and sales potential of pop-up experiences:<br></p><ul><li>Mobile marketing</li><li>Hybrid events</li><li>Influencer partnerships</li></ul><h3>1. Mobile marketing</h3><p>Do you have a sprinter van that’s in good condition? Hope might want it.<br></p><p>“We’re seeing way more requests for mobile marketing—pop-ups that are mobile, whether in a refurbished fire truck or sprinter van, which are not tied down to a particular state or location and where you don’t have to sign a lease,” she says.<br></p><p>Brands either rent a vehicle for a shorter circuit, like to hit a few surf spots in lower California to create content and engagement with that community, or buy a vehicle and kit it out with plans to use it for multiple months or years, like on a cross-country tour.<br></p><p>“Today’s world is a little bit uneasy, so that’s an easy way for people to do it.

The Business Strategy Behind The eCommerce Boom: 4 Insights From E&Y Data Scientist Tanmaya Pisal	the-business-strategy-behind-the-ecommerce-boom-4-insights-from-e-y-data-scientist-tanmaya-pisal	The Business Strategy Behind The eCommerce Boom: 4 Insights From E&Y Data Scientist Tanmaya Pisal	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60afb46670dd8ca09720c0d6_The%20Business%20Strategy%20Behind%20The%20eCommerce%20Boom%205.jpg	<p>Most STEM fields aren’t quite as black and white as we might expect them to be. Doctors don’t always know exactly what’s going on with their patients, engineers know there’s often no one right way to solve a given problem, and even mathematicians need to get theoretical and abstract.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who watched the <em>New York Times</em>’ prediction needle for the 2016 election knows that data science isn’t an exact science, either.</p><p>That’s because simply having data isn’t the same thing as deriving actionable insights from it.&nbsp;</p><p>Making meaning of data requires not just capturing it, but maintaining it, processing it, analyzing it, and communicating it creatively. It requires exploration, experimentation, and inventiveness every step of the way, from the framing questions you ask to the lateral connections you make within data sets.</p><p>Less data science, more data art, perhaps?</p><p>That’s certainly Tanmaya Pisal’s view.</p><h2><strong>Learning to listen to the data</strong></h2><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60afb47203f4ff1f15442b3b__jPVwEFk6Sa75jvLL5BXD1yfL0d6vm7aSO4kSyhwUZBHDmSUWdWGI4rnjynU7pNfMR701k0qigX6w0xvpUEwJGIYcLefGA8zFuotI33AcQJZHamFpEas2x-6qCspO_THj0JPxkOE.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>As a Data Scientist / Senior Data Analytics Consultant at Ernst &amp; Young, Tanmaya has adopted a flexible view on problem-solving in the real world.</p><p>When she was completing her master’s in data analytics and data science at the University of Maryland, College Park, Tanmaya analyzed data in relatively controlled environments. For example, for a predictive analytics project using Airbnb data, Tanmaya and her team were able to create a clear framework for their insights. “Based on the AUC (area under the curve) we got, after factoring in the sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity of the model we decided on thresholds and divided the investors into three categories: risk seeking, risk averse, and risk neutral,” she explains.</p><p>But while those three categories look nice and neat on paper, that’s not exactly how regular consumers behave.</p><p>“Segregation never really works in real life,” she says. “You can never put an investor or a buyer in just one box; there are mixed behaviors we need to keep in mind.”</p><p>Classroom learning did give her a strong foundation for data science, but Tanmaya has had to learn to step beyond those bounds when analyzing client projects. “There are strategies or methods which would’ve worked on a specific type of data in books, but no longer work with real data,” she explains.</p><p>Still, Tanmaya does rely on a favorite maxim of one of her data science professors: “Always listen to and be patient with data.” Even the ways that she and her colleagues approach listening to data are key to the insights they can glean from it. From coming up with new methods for sorting and cleaning data to patiently sifting through individual data sets to spark her curiosity, Tanmaya has learned to follow the 20/80 rule: for every new machine learning model she wants to build, she needs to spend five times as long preprocessing her data, getting up close and personal with it.</p><p>“Patience with data is the key to obtaining phenomenal insights you hope to get from it,” she says.</p><p>That patience comes in handy with supplementing her own education, too. Tanmaya went for her master’s in data science because she was passionate about the field; she did her final undergrad projection opinion on mining and sentimental analysis. Back then, there weren’t many experienced data scientist professors or mentors at her school, so the head of her department gave her the option to either change her project topic or to go forward but without much help from the department.</p><p>“I was determined to work in that domain, hence I went forward with NLP (Natural Language Processing),” says Tanmaya. She did, and it was successful—after a lot of hit-and-miss exploration and sleepless nights, her project was one of the top in her cohort. After several years of working in business intelligence and data analytics, teaching herself more along the way, Tanmaya went for her master’s, and now at EY uses a mix of techniques she learned in school and things she’s picked up from work projects.</p><p>“My work at EY [involves] challenging myself by learning and evolving, and to some point unlearning and relearning based on the ever-changing work dynamics,” she says. “The data field is evolving, and you as an analyst or scientist have to evolve, too. I am loving the process.”</p><h2><strong>4 predictions for the (near-term) future of eCommerce</strong></h2><p>Imagine you’re surfing a wave. You feel the water go beyond the buoyancy required to keep you afloat and start to actually lift up, to curve away from the surface, to climb in the air.</p><p>That’s where Tanmaya thinks data science is when it comes to eComm insights: sitting on a wave of change that is ready to crash over the whole industry.</p><p>“We’ll look back at 2020 as the year that changed everything,” she says, referencing the unprecedented and unanticipated growth of the sector amid the COVID-19 crisis for not just big players like Amazon and Alibaba but for all industries across businesses of all sizes.</p><div></div><p>Tanmaya is currently working on a project with an eCommerce sports and retail giant and says that she’s betting on newly-acquired customer habits sticking around for the long haul. “The boost in digital sales and opportunities...to capitalize on investment in new sales channels are massive,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, there are a few things Tanmaya is expecting to see unfold.</p><p>First, she approaches the art of data science by explaining her tools: “The 3 Vs: volume, variety, and velocity, which provide the leverage to companies to access critical information about customers' experiences, finance, and the competitiveness of the marketplace,” she says.</p><p>She then puts those tools in context, explaining that while traditionally data could be a strategic and competitive advantage by improving strategic decisions, operational efficiency, cost efficiency, and customer understanding, going forward, data will do more than streamline or improve existing business processes and will instead demand the creation of entirely new ones. That’s where creativity will be even more needed: not just in what to ask the data about the future of eComm, but what building towards that future will actually look like.</p><p>“This is just the beginning of [data’s] long reign,” she says. Here are four areas where she expects to see its impact:</p><h3>1. <strong>Blanket marketing will be no more. </strong></h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Gone will be the days of getting a generic sales email with deals of the week, says Tanmaya: “Improved big data analytics will definitely put an end to blanket marketing.” Someone who regularly buys gluten-free food items will never get a regular pasta recommendation, and customers who just bought home appliances will stop seeing fridge ads, but will get specific offers on fridge organizers, magnetic calendars, and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>That means traditional email marketing is in for a huge makeover, along with all the copywriting, art direction, ad sales, and engineering industries that support it. As marketing goes from macro to micro, niche industries that use these new tools well will have a real opportunity to find lasting, loyal customers.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. <strong>The robots are definitely coming for our jobs. </strong></h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Not all of them—just the customer service jobs. “Within some years, it won’t be a surprise to see 24/7 smooth customer service provided by AI chatbots,” says Tanmaya. “In a decade, when we are dealing with several zettabytes of data, Artificial Intelligence and other advanced analytics techniques will play a crucial role in driving value from that amount of raw data.”</p><p>Sure, a human customer service rep can solve problems just as well (and right now, better) than a Siri or Alexa or generic chatbot equivalent, but will that human be able to automatically come up with new scripts for new problems as soon as they come up, optimizing them for customer satisfaction and efficiency from the get-go? Probably not. AI-powered chatbots were ushered in ahead of schedule when call centers couldn’t operate because of COVID, says Tanmaya, and they ended up not just answering queries but also being successful taking orders—so maybe salespeople should keep an eye out, too. Tanmaya says that her data shows that 25% of customers have used smart assistants to place orders or add items to their shopping list, showing that consumers are on board with buying via robots.&nbsp;</p><p>All that to say, our future AI robot friends will still need someone like Tanmaya to set them up, direct their exploration and evolution via thoughtful questions, and make meaning of their findings—so a career in data science (and art) is looking better and better, isn’t it?</p><h3>3. <strong>Step aside, likes and dislikes, and meet microinsights. </strong></h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Sure, Facebook knows that you’re a fan of a cappella groups, <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and the barbeque place down the block. But does YouTube know when you’re feeling sad and could use a good rendition of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”? Can Netflix tell what you’ll think of the new season even before you’ve vocalized a thought on the matter? Does Amazon successfully remind you to buy a bottle of Tums before a Friday night rib fest? None of them do that now, but according to Tanmaya, they all will soon.</p><p>She expects to see an increase in the granularity of insights that will then transform the way that advertisers and social media platforms interact with us. A series of tiny insights about who we are and how we live our lives will build up to be a ridiculously accurate picture of us, allowing for hyper-personalized recommendations that we’ll probably come to see as helpful and not entirely creepy.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’ll be able to predict [consumers’] underlying needs and opinions and provide them better recommendations,” says Tanmaya, referencing rapid advances in machine learning and natural language processing that will make quick work of enormous pools of data.</p><p>That means that companies like Amazon and Sephora that already make much of their revenue from successful recommendation programs will make even more of it that way, and newer companies that can gain access to big data insights on customer trends will have a real chance to win customers with hyper-personalization.</p><h3>4. <strong>Goodbye, Amazon Web Services. </strong></h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Say it isn’t so: might Amazon’s cash cow go belly up? Possibly, says Tanmaya, who expects that eComm vendors will invest directly in dedicated servers, taking their data analytics and storage powers into their own hands. Cutting-edge cloud technologies will be the foundation of the future of big data, and if more innovative players come onto the market, stalwarts like AWS might be a thing of the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Learn more about what all this data means for eComm from our series on big data trends in 2021, featuring expert interviews and </em></strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/join-clyde-1540461/walking-the-roadmap-saatvas-ricky-joshi"><strong><em>reflections on the future of the field</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p>	Thu May 27 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

To stay abreast of the latest trends and developments within the space, we’ve invested time and resources to remain well read on the subjects that matter most to our customers. Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Holiday Promotions Are On The Move</strong><br></h3><p>Last year, COVID lockdowns and safety protocols forced the hand of major retailers across the country. In lieu of offering their annual in-person Black Friday deals, retailers quickly closed their doors and moved their best sales promotions online. Consumers adapted to the new eCommerce playing field quickly, driving up eCommerce spending by<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/us-ecommerce-sales/"> 44% in 2020</a>. That spike has provided retailers with enough confidence to willingly close their doors on Thanksgiving, instead of waiting for health and safety news surrounding the Delta Variant.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/611406501bc6ed78ea463efa_MhkQT74eXUlRFHR-Dy9oHePKlQEaiLE9HQFjJzLu8s--jXQpsj4ILaAgCAqnBkJwSPyz21Ekg2kyB16k2Kjbw-UZ-wLWgz-sVjYa_F6bauIeiPJaFnjZn_e2r1i-iaBxSMPJpmQb.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p>A growing list of major retailers like<a href="https://blackfriday.com/news/stores-closed-thanksgiving"> Walmart, Target, Kohl’s and Best Buy</a> have all confirmed closures on Turkey Day, and have begun announcing<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/holiday-2021-best-buy-closed-on-thanksgiving-day-black-friday-deals-online.html"> new holiday season promotional plans</a>. But the elephant in the room for Q4 remains Amazon. The retail giant dropped one of its gravity-altering Prime Days into mid-October last year. Because of its massive success, there remains buzz that Amazon will once again double-down on Prime Day. “<a href="https://tracker.tradedoubler.com/click?p=265883&a=3009146&g=22913796&epi=trd-us-2132040998116105200&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.adobe.com%2Fresources%2Fdigital-economy-index.html">Adobe Analytics</a> tracked $10.4 billion in sales over last year's October event, and $11 billion during the Prime Day 2021. That means an October event remains an incredibly lucrative prospect for the retailer, and now that it knows interest is sustainable throughout the year we may be entering a new era of the double Prime Day,” wrote Tabitha Baker of<a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/amazon-prime-day/new-prime-day-deals"> TechRadar</a> last month.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Should Amazon pull the trigger on an October Prime Day, industry analysts believe retailers will be scrambling to move up their holiday sales to keep pace. “Prime Day is no longer just a day for people to purchase cheap items on Amazon,” wrote<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/shopping/amazon-prime-day/amazon-prime-day-history-n1269819"> CNBC’s Annie Palmer</a> earlier this summer. “Quite frankly, it has completely altered the retail calendar.”<br></p><h3><strong>Online Retailers' Wait For Tax Relief Continues</strong><br></h3><p>The U.S. Supreme Court case, <em>South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., </em>ruled that states can require out-of-state companies to collect sales taxes on online transactions, even if those sellers have no retail store, office, warehouse or other physical presence in the state. For thousands of online businesses that meant the onerous task of compliance.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As a result, lobbyists have attempted to sway Congress to streamline and simplify the tax ramifications for online businesses by creating national sales tax legislation.<a href="https://vogelgroupdc.com/team/brian-johnson/"> Brian Johnson of The Vogel Group</a>, a lobbyist for ACMA (American Catalog Mailers Association), has kept close tabs on Congressional interest in creating new rules. “Tax issues just aren’t prevalent enough for a lot of committee members to have staff that have a deep understanding of the issue,” Johnson told<a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2021/08/05/congress-is-slow-to-act-on-online-sales-tax/"> Digital Commerce 360</a>. “We spend a lot of time educating around this issue, the history of the <em>Wayfair</em> case, and the complexities businesses are still facing.” He did note that six members of Congress had petitioned the General Accounting Office to update its 2017 study&nbsp; on the cost of sales tax collection. But as of today that request has not been responded to by the GAO.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Small Business Boom</strong><br></h3><p>National Public Radio’s podcast “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/15/1016628762/the-covid-small-business-boom">The Indicator</a>” recently detailed the small business boom. The latest business formation numbers were just released and the entrepreneurial momentum remains strong. Americans started over 440 thousand businesses in June 2021. The sixteen-month period from March 2020 to June 2021 marks a record high for business startups. Which factors are responsible for this wave of entrepreneurs?

To stay abreast of the latest trends and developments within the space, we’ve invested time and resources to remain well-read on the subjects that matter most to our customers. Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Supply Chain Issues To Impact Back-To-School Inventories</strong>&nbsp;<br></h3><p>According to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2021/07/23/school-supply-shortage-backpack-shoes-could-sell-out/8071293002/">USA Today</a>, products are “expected to be in tight supply and more expensive this year due to more classrooms fully reopening after a year of virtual learning and supply chain issues as a result of COVID-19.”&nbsp;<br></p><p>“While we are unlikely to see apocalyptic shortages, the continued pressure on supply chains means that not all retailers will get an optimal amount of supply,” Neil Saunders, managing director of consultancy GlobalData Retail, told USA TODAY. "What this means is consumers will have less choice, and some may not be able to get exactly what they want, especially towards the end of the back-to-school season."&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:45%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/611d1badd5dfbe093e17f259_Chinese%20Ports%20COVID%20Rates.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Continued instability at Chinese ports all but ensures that these supply chain issues will not be resolved in the coming months. News out of Shanghai-Ningbo, the world’s third-busiest container port, indicates another major slowdown is on the way. The port instituted a partial closure last week after a dock worker became infected with the delta variant of Covid-19. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-18/supply-chains-latest-china-s-port-shutdowns-hit-world-trade-outlook">Bloomberg News</a> has reported that major shipping lines are having to skip Ningbo, due to the backlog. For a sense of the backlog, consider this: There were 141 ships at a shared anchorage for the Shanghai and Ningbo ports Tuesday, 60 more than the median number from April to August, according to Bloomberg’s calculations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Such snarls are leaving manufacturers with little hope for near-term relief,” wrote Edna Curran of Bloomberg.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Supply chain bottlenecks aren’t the only thing driving prices higher. As reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/covid-back-to-school-supply-shortages-81a822c7-ae86-4d23-9b60-4c54e785e46d.html">Axios</a>, customers can expect to pay anywhere from 10% to 15% more on apparel and supplies due to a 6% inflation in apparel.

Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.</p><h3>Empowering Customers To Sidestep Supply Chain Bottlenecks<br></h3><p>Earlier this fall, <a href="http://Digital.com">Digital.com</a> reported that nearly half of all small business owners in the US were anticipating inventory shortages through the 2021 holiday season. Those fears related to this holiday season have sadly come to fruition for many retailers who were unable to offer their full array of products to their customers. Nearly every company, large and small, has had to contend with shipping delays on both sides of the business (manufacturing and last-mile distribution). <br></p><p>These rampant supply chain issues have had a trickle down effect on consumers in three separate ways. The first domino to fall was the availability of products. Physical and digital shelves lay bear during the holiday season for most retailers, particularly in their best selling categories. <br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:35%"><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/6-creative-ways-retailers-can-deal-with-supply-chain-nightmares-this-holiday-season" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61685d47700b087257b2b4e3_Direct%20to%20Consumer%20-%20Option%203.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>Clyde's 6 Creative Ways To Deal With Supply Chain Issues</figcaption></figure><p>The second impact that consumers have felt is prolonged shipping delays. Congestion at the Port of LA, which processes nearly 40 percent all of US imports, is just one indicator of how dire American shipping issues are today. Even once containers are processed, with current wait times averaging more than six weeks, trucking and warehouse issues are compounding shipping delays. Worker shortages at warehouses, mean that tractor trailers are sitting and waiting to be unloaded and processed. All of this is contributing to a domestic supply chain that is stuck in neutral across the country. <br></p><p>When you combine these issues together, companies are opting to pass down their costs to customers. Last week the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that The Consumer Price Index rose 6.8 percent from November 2020 November 2021, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1982. Consumers are feeling the economic burden being passed to them at every turn, with non-discretionary items like energy costs rising by 33.3 percent year over year. <br></p><p>So how can merchants help consumers? One idea is borrowing a strategy from Etsy. The eCommerce peer-to-peer marketplace provides customers with the ability to search for products and sellers by location.<br></p><p>“Not only can users filter products that are produced within their country, but they can zero it in to only display sellers from within their own states. This passes a great deal of control to consumers, giving them the power to choose where their products come from and whom their purchases empower. And it's not just that consumers want to support their microeconomy from the comfort of their homes,” wrote Kelly Main of Inc. just this past week. <br></p><div></div><p><br></p><p>The upshot here is that consumers can cut down on shipping costs, while guaranteeing the arrival of their purchases before the holidays. Buying locally used to be the standard before widespread globalization moved points of production and distribution all over the world. But merchants can offer still offer a similar experience with enhanced Buy Online Pick-Up In Store (BOPIS) options, strategic warehousing of products in densely populated areas and outsourcing of production to local manufacturers where available. <br></p><p>To learn more about how to prepare for the great supply-chain crunch of 2022, <a href="https://www.inc.com/anna-meyer/christmas-rush-youre-already-too-late-retailers-need-to-plan-now-for-2022.html">click here</a>. <br></p><h3>Militarizing Your Supply Chain Operations<br></h3><p>Sounds intense, right? Well not for Basic Fun! CEO Jay Foreman. This toymaker has created a military-style operation around its supply chain to ensure that their toys end up where they need to be this holiday season. To learn more from Foreman and the creative solutions merchants are trotting out this holiday season, listen in to this nine minute podcast from NPR.<br><br></p><div></div><p><br></p><h3>Augmented Reality In eCommerce</h3><p>Illumix Founder and CEO Kirin Sinha sat down with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang to talk about her how company's technology is raising the bar for the level of accuracy in integrating the digital and physical worlds. &nbsp;It’s a reality at Disney Parks today, but could play a much larger role for eCommerce companies sooner rather than later. <br></p><div></div><p><br></p>	Fri Dec 17 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.</p><h3>How Companies Build Loyalty, Membership and Registration Programs<br></h3><p>Winning and retaining customers is the name of the game in eCommerce. Companies are achieving the “retaining” side of that equation in three separate ways. Here’s a look at the three main programs companies use to achieve their retention goals.<br></p><h4><strong>Loyalty</strong><br></h4><p>According to Accenture, more than <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-43/accenture-strategy-gcpr-customer-loyalty.pdf">90% of companies</a> have some type of customer loyalty program. These programs have exploded in popularity because they’ve proven themselves to be the most effective tactic for increasing revenue and inspiring customer loyalty. From that same Accenture report, “as many as 84% of consumers say they’re more apt to stick with a brand that offers a loyalty program. And 66% of customers say the ability to earn rewards actually changes their spending behavior.”<br></p><p>So how can eCommerce merchants launch their own programs? Here are five assessment points that brands can grade their programs against:<br></p><p><strong>Ease &amp; enjoyment:</strong> How easy is to access the perks of the loyalty program and how much do customers enjoy said perks. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall satisfaction:</strong> Were the customers’ expectations fulfilled or exceeded? </p><p><strong>Customer support:</strong> Track the ease or difficulty of signing up for the program and how streamlined the experience of redeeming benefits was for customers. </p><p><strong>Trust:</strong> Survey customers to find out if they trusted the loyalty program, specially how they felt about sharing personal data.</p><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Measure the likelihood of a customer recommending the program to friends and family.<br></p><h4><strong>Membership</strong><br></h4><p>Big-box retailers like Walmart have launched membership programs in the past two years and have experienced tremendous results. Walmart+ launched in September of 2020 as a direct response to Amazon Prime. The program costs $98 a year, or $12.95 on a monthly basis, and includes perks like fuel and prescription discounts, free delivery of grocery orders of $35 or more, and free shipping for online purchases.<br></p><p>As reported by CNBC’s Melissa Repko, “Walmart tapped Chris Cracchiolo, a veteran of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP">American Express</a>, to lead its membership program, and it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/walmart-to-ramp-up-automated-fulfillment-at-its-stores-as-online-grocery-grows.html">has added automation</a> to dozens of stores to crank up capacity for online grocery orders, one of the program’s key perks.” The incentives vary throughout the year and currently extend to giveaways of air fryers and exercise bikes. These mini giveaways and sales are akin to Amazon’s “Prime Day,” just on a smaller scale. <br></p><p>Mike Levin, a partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, believes that these programs achieve a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/24/walmart-kicks-off-exclusive-sales-event-for-walmart-members.html">simple and trackable goal</a>: Those who sign up for membership programs buy more. <br></p><p>Levin told CNBC this week that, similar to members of warehouse clubs like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COST">Costco</a> and Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, subscribers are “paying for the privilege” — creating another revenue stream for companies and an incentive for customers to go to stores and websites to get their money’s worth.<br></p><p>“They’re just there a lot more often,” he said. “That’s like a fantasy for retailers.”<br></p><h4><strong>Registration</strong><br></h4><p>When registration programs are executed properly, customers that buy products via third parties are presenting brands with vital information. An example would be a customer buying a vacuum cleaner via Amazon, but finding a QR code label on the vacuum itself and using it to register with the original vacuum manufacturer. <br></p><p>Why is this important? <br></p><p>Amazon used to give third-party sellers the names and addresses of all of their Amazon buyers. It wasn’t comprehensive consumer intel, but it was something. Then, in <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/amazon-briefing-the-growing-customer-data-war/">April 2021</a>, Amazon changed its policy, and they no longer automatically provide buyer information to sellers. This has become increasingly common among major third-party platforms. <br></p><p>Registration programs allow brands to turn the customer data spigot back on without breaking the bank. Labels and stickers are a cost effective option to provide customers with the option of sharing their personal information. From there, brands can choose a host of incentive options. Many companies use it as a way to eliminate paper waste by linking their QR codes to instruction manuals. For brands willing to spend a bit more, QR codes can be linked to giveaways, exclusive promotions, discounts and early-access to upgrades. And the beauty of the QR code itself is that brands can change the user-destination at any time. So a special holiday promotion can swapped for a discount code without changing the physical label or sticker. </p><h3><strong>How Consumers And Retailers Can Reduce Returns</strong></h3><div></div><p><br></p><p>Americans return about 30% of their online purchases, costing retailers billions of dollars and creating mountains of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbcearth.com/news/your-brand-new-returns-end-up-in-landfill">environmental waste</a>. <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/faculty/gadallon/" target="_blank">Gad Allon</a>, a Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, wants to change that.</p><p>The National Retail Federation cited online returns, which more than doubled from 2019 to 2020, as the main driver in the growth of returns. Each return erodes the profit margin of the item, especially if the retailer covers the cost of return shipping. Amazon, Walmart, and other big vendors can absorb those losses to some degree, Allon said, but small businesses simply cannot afford it.<br></p><p>Listen in to learn how Allon is working with companies and researching ways to improve the reverse supply chain. </p><h3>eCommerce Boom Is All About Differentiating Online</h3><div></div><p>Bloomreach Co-founder and CEO Raj De Datta joins Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman and Brian Sozzi to discuss the state of eCommerce platforms and technology funding.

Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.</p><h3><strong>5 Trends Shaping the Future of eCommerce</strong><br></h3><p>As reported by Statista, the eCommerce market reached $3.3 trillion in revenue in 2021 with that figure expected to top $4 trillion by 2024. As the eCommerce pie grows, so too does competition for customers. <br></p><p>In a recent article published by <a href="https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/resources/5-trends-shaping-the-future-of-ecommerce">Retail Touchpoints</a>, five eCommerce trends were singled out. A combination of tactics and technologies are set to play a major role in 2022. <br></p><ol><li><strong>Omnichannel shopping</strong> — 74% of customers do online research before visiting a physical store;</li><li><strong>AI and AR</strong> — these tools will be increasingly essential to retailers as capabilities such as AI-enabled chatbots and personalized shopping experiences become the norm;</li><li><strong>New payment options</strong> — frictionless is the name of the game in eCommerce, and that includes offering customers a variety of ways to pay for their purchases — from digital wallets and mobile payments to cryptocurrency;</li><li><strong>Visual commerce</strong> — sophisticated visual communication through video, high-quality photos and AR is increasingly important to grab consumers’ attention amid the onslaught of content online; and</li><li><strong>Data-driven dynamic pricing </strong>— Optimizing pricing strategies to stay competitive as more players enter the eCommerce arena will be crucial.<br></li></ol><p>Ominchannel shopping refers to brands that integrate both their digital and brick-and-mortar sales channels at the same time. For instance that could mean connecting with a potential customer face-to-face, via their smartphone, and within their customer service platform. According to <a href="https://logiq.com/">Logiq</a>, 74% of customers in 2021 conducted online research before visiting a physical store, the highest percentage since that data point was first tracked in 2010. <br></p><p>Augmented Reality is expected to explode in coming years, with research from Fact &amp; Factors estimating the global AR market reaching $88.4 billion by 2026. This technology is particularly useful for retailers marketing products for the home. Augmented reality can help customers figure out exactly how furniture, kitchen appliances and workout equipment will fit in their homes. <br></p><p>Ultimately, dynamic payment options achieve one critical outcome for retails: a reduction in cart abandonment figures. Digital wallets, mobile payments, and even cryptocurrency compatibility help retailers access customers who would previously have been on the sidelines. <br></p><p>Retail Touchpoints article also pointed out that multimedia is no longer a nice-to-have feature for a retailer, it’s a must-have. High-quality product photos, video content and augmented reality offerings are a highly effective way to create a positive brand image. <br></p><p>Finally, data-driven dynamic pricing is quickly becoming a key differentiator for eCommerce businesses. In a paper written by Dimitris Bertsimas and Phebe Vayanos of <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/papers/Robust%20Optimization/Data-driven%20learning%20in%20dynamic%20pricing%20using%20adaptive%20optimization.pdf">MIT</a>, dynamic pricing is described in this way. <br></p><p><em>"Dynamic pricing policies have been long-employed in the travel, hospitality, and energy sectors (where short-term capacity is rigid) to mitigate imbalances in supply and demand. The main reason for the early adoption of dynamic pricing strategies in these industries was the ability to change prices at low cost and in a centralized fashion. In contrast, in industries with more flexible supply, </em><strong><em>such as retail</em></strong><em>, imbalances between supply and demand have traditionally been moderated by means of dynamic inventory control. While active inventory management is a useful tool for increasing profit, it only serves to decrease costs. Dynamic pricing on the other hand provides a means for also affecting revenues provided the population to which the product is offered is price-sensitive. Unfortunately, high menu costs precluded such industries from regularly adjusting their prices. The emergence of the internet as a sales channel and the increasing use of digital price tags have drastically decreased such costs, while technological advances are by and large permitting the automation of price changes. Dynamic pricing is thus becoming ubiquitous across most industries, enabling retailers to leverage on both sides of the profit equation."</em><br></p><p>To give perspective on the impact dynamic pricing can have, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/solutions/periscope/solutions/b2c-pricing-solutions/b2c-price-optimization">McKinsey</a> recently conducted a pilot program and found that a major retailer experienced “a 3% increase in both revenue and margins,” while utilizing dynamic pricing. <br></p><h3><strong>Warehouses Needed</strong><br></h3><p>According to CBRE, “eCommerce expansion that will fuel the need for more warehouse space, along with the “growing economy, population migration and the desire for ‘safety stock’ onshore.” eCommerce sales grew 21.6% to total retail sales for Q2 2020, which was up from 16.2% the previous quarter, as the result of the pandemic. And for Q3 2021, sales are still above pre-pandemic levels at 20%. This trend will continue in 2022.”<br></p><p>Material Handling &amp; Logistics News quantified the exact needs of businesses in 2022. “As eCommerce sales continue, so too does the need for more warehouses. In Q3 of 2021, 448.9 million sq. ft. of space was under construction, which sets a record. This number does reflect projects that were not completed due to the pandemic. And this demand will continue, the report notes. In 2022, availability will remain tight, particularly for Class A space, leading to a higher number of lease renewals. While this will support high rents, it may slow the pace of new leasing activity in 2022. For these reasons and others, such as a lack of available space in highly populated areas and challenges with finding enough workers to operate facilities, retailers and wholesalers will look to outsource functions to third-party logistics companies (3PLs).</p><h3><strong>Full (Ware)House</strong><br></h3><div></div><p><br></p><p>NPR’s financial podcast “The Indicator” also examined the world of warehouses and how the evolution of American shopping habits have brought the industry to a breaking point.</p><h3><strong>Tech Tailwinds</strong></h3><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:40%"><a href="https://go.joinclyde.com/WP-TechTailwinds.html" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61ddf8604096bd45fafd1d08_Tech%20Tailwinds.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a></figure><p>To succeed in the current eCommerce climate merchants need a dynamic and efficient tech stack. Outsourcing those needs has become the industry standard. So too has the need to for these disparate technologies to “talk to one another” while sharing data safely and efficiently. <br></p><p>But what about cost? Is your tech stack still a financial anchor that is only viewed as a line item, a mere cost of doing business? <br></p><p>What if you could create a cashflow-positive tech stack?

To stay abreast of the latest trends and developments within the space, we’ve invested time and resources to remain well read on the subjects that matter most to our customers. Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.<br></p><h3>Bundling Benefits With Elite Customer Service<br></h3><p>One of the buzzwords dominating the world of eCommerce this fall has been “skimpflation.” Greg Rosalsky, a co-host of NPR’s “Planet Money,” offered a straightforward explanation of the phenomenon. “It's when, instead of simply raising prices, companies skimp on the goods and services they provide,” wrote Rosalsky last month. <br></p><p>But the tactic isn’t just about companies lining their pockets, in a lot of ways it boils down to economic survival. “Skimping has a derogatory connotation, and, we should note, not all companies are Cruella de Vil or Scrooge McDuck. Many businesses, especially small businesses, are struggling to cope with surging costs and pandemic-related expenses. They're having a hard time finding workers at the wages they used to pay. And some businesses may be unable to afford paying what it takes to recruit workers in the current environment,” wrote Rosalsky. <br></p><p>Companies of all sizes feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either your margins take a haircut or you pass down those rising costs to customers. But there’s a third option on the table currently being explored by a Big Box retailer. <br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/best-buy-totaltech-this-200-subscription-could-help-get-a-ps5/" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/619ba7fd11243f726a493949_Best%20Buy%20PS5.jpeg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>Best Buy's new subscription provides Geek Squad access along with early access to some of the holiday season's most sought after gifts, including the elusive PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>Best Buy is attempting to address customer services issues by offering a new “Totaltech” membership. This offering lets the user access Geek Squad support 24×7. They can use the members-only prices, two years of product protection, standard installation, and free delivery. This is accomplishing three things for Best Buy. The first is that it’s funding a dedicated customer support wing of its business. The second is that it’s serving as an effective outreach tool. Exclusive sales, early access and customized experiences are all embedded within this membership, tactics that have proven to be effective when attempting to increase AOV. And finally, despite the $199.99 price tag, this program has the potential to build brand loyalty as other companies raise the white flag in the customer support department. <br></p><p>Peter Keith, a Piper Sandler analyst, is <a href="https://www.ecommercenext.org/best-buy-is-rolling-out-a-tech-support-subscription/">optimistic about the new program</a>. He believes that it will be a “potential game-changer” for the industry. His recent analysis said that the company would likely create a 3% boost in sales right away, with a 5-8 percent boost in&nbsp;earnings on the horizon in the next one to two years. </p><h3>Small Business Attempt A New Balancing Act </h3><p>Big-box retailers like Home Depot, Target and Walmart made it clear to investors last week that they were well stocked and ready to go for the holiday push. And while it remains to be seen if that is 100% accurate, small and medium sized businesses are not in the same boat. These retailers and businesses are fighting off inflation and supply chain issues that are currently packing a real punch. Many are having to balance price increases that won’t alienate customers with creative solutions in order to protect their bottom line. They’re doing things like slimming down selections, cutting hours or adding storage space. For more on this topic, have a listen to "Marketplace"&nbsp;hosted by Kai Ryssdal. The award-winning podcast takes you beyond the numbers, bringing you context. Their team of reporters from all over the world speak with CEOs, policymakers and regular people just trying to get by.</p><div></div><h3>‍<br>Experiential Stocking Stuffers<br></h3><p>About 43% of consumers plan to redirect their spending to experiences and service gifts this holiday season, according to a holiday shopping <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/21/holiday-shopping-2021-4-ways-shoppers-have-changed-since-the-pandemic-began.html">survey of roughly 1,500 U.S. consumers</a> in August by consulting firm Accenture. That is even higher among younger generations, with 53% of millennials and 50% of Gen Z saying they are redirecting to more experiential spending, the survey found.<br></p><p>“There’s a pent-up need to get the heck out,” said Jill Standish, head of Accenture’s retail industry group.</p><div></div><p>And it's not just the research team at Accenture that has spotted this trend. According to a study by the Harris Group, <a href="https://www.vendhq.com/blog/experiential-retail/">72% of millennials</a> would rather open their wallets for experiences rather than products. </p><p>Interested in learning how you can incorporate experiences into your product line?&nbsp;Here's a <a href="https://www.vendhq.com/blog/experiential-retail/">seven step guide from VendHQ</a> that can get you headed in the right direction.

To stay abreast of the latest trends and developments within the space, we’ve invested time and resources to remain well read on the subjects that matter most to our customers. Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.</p><h3>Despite Supply Chain Bottlenecks, Record Sales Are Projected For This Holiday Season<br></h3><p>The National Retail Federation released estimates on Wednesday which project holiday sales during November and December to rise between 8.5% and 10.5% year-over year. In total, the NRF believes that the US will see between $843.4 billion and $859 billion of sales.<br></p><p>For perspective, holiday retail sales have grown year-over-year by an average of 4.4% in the past five cycles.&nbsp;<a href="">Melissa Repko of CNBC</a> noted that, “last year, holiday sales rose 8.2% from 2019 to $777.3 billion, according to the NRF, as consumers cheered themselves up with gift-giving during the pandemic.” That Q4 bump help stabilize a rocky year for retailers across the board. <br></p><p>This year, NRF President and CEO Matt Shay believes that sales have stabilized as consumers have eased into new spending patterns. More time at home, stimulus funds and the gradual reopening of brick and mortar locations in the wake of widespread vaccine availability, has all led to a buying bonanza. <br></p><p>Shay did acknowledge this week on a conference call with the media that supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages will cause headaches for merchants and consumers alike, but that strategic inventory management on the part of US retailers should keep the flow of goods moving through the holiday season. <br></p><p>“It’s not as if there are not some headwinds and challenges, and yet in spite of that, we have a great deal of confidence that consumers will continue to power the economy in this last quarter of the year,” he said on a call with reporters on Wednesday.<br></p><p>Shoppers have also begun their holiday shopping earlier than ever, a trend that could offer supply chains some relief in the coming months. <br></p><p>A final interesting note from Shay’s conference call: vaccinated tourists. Starting November 8th, international tourists with proof of vaccination will be able to visit the US. Shay closed the call by noting that “we think that’s also going to give a jolt to the retail side.” <br></p><h4>Trends From Major Retailers<br></h4><p>At Clyde we’re always on the lookout for scalable solutions and tactics that can help our merchants drive higher revenues while sidesteping potential pitfalls. Major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Target and Best Buy have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/29/holiday-shopping-2021-target-kicks-off-deals-oct-10-with-price-matching.html">announced</a> earlier holiday sales events, but they haven’t stopped there. <br></p><p>All four are now offering <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/holiday-2021-walmart-members-get-first-dibs-on-black-friday-deals.html">exclusive access</a> to products for loyal customers, which includes early access to Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals. This is helping these companies alleviate supply chain logjams by moving products ahead of the holiday season, while also building stronger relationships with their customers. This is a great way to organically build customer loyalty while fostering a positive brand image. <br></p><h3>Interested In Customer Outreach Techniques, &lt;INSERT FIRST NAME HERE&gt;?<br></h3><div></div><p>The Indicator, an NPR podcast focused on business tactics and the economy, examined a tried-and-true sales tactic that may be backfiring more than you think. Repeating a customer's name is a common practice among salespeople because it can build trust with the customer, but does it work in every situation (in-person, email, text)?<br></p><p>Harvard marketing professor Frank Cespedes says the strategy is backed up by science, and is important, especially when it comes to one particular category of sales. Want to find out what that category is? Listen in! <br></p><h3>Is Your Company Ready To Move Ultrafast?<br></h3><p>Gopuff, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/gopuff-ceo-co-ceo-yakir-gola-said-it-has-a-better/lasting-business-model-in-crowded-field-of-delivery-start-ups.html">a pioneer in the “instant needs” category, </a>launched Wednesday in New York City. Gopuff delivers daily essentials in minutes, from food delivery and home essentials to baby items and pet products. The new company is even testing alcohol delivery in select markets. The upshot is that companies like Gopuff can deliver in urban areas within an average of 30 minutes. Industry analysts believe if the first few providers through the wall show promise, this "instant need"&nbsp;category is set to explode in the coming years. </p><p>“When Amazon came out with two-day Prime [delivery], that was the most revolutionary thing,” Yakir Gola, co-founder and co-CEO of Gopuff. told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/gopuff-gorillas-and-others-flood-new-york-with-instant-delivery-options.html">CNBC</a>&nbsp;this week. “Now, people want it in 20 minutes. In 10 years, people are going to want it in five, 10 minutes. At the end of the day, people value time, so you have to keep innovating.”</p><div></div><p>This wave of instant delivery also represents a way for small and medium sized businesses to compete with the major retailers who have already built their own express delivery systems. Walmart has a two-hour or less express delivery option and Target owns the same-day delivery service Shipt. Ulta Beauty and LVMH-owned Sephora recently announced plans for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/19/ulta-beauty-to-focus-on-speedy-delivery-as-some-pandemic-habits-stick.html">same-day delivery</a> of lotion, lipstick and other beauty goods in select markets. Developing an "instant need"&nbsp;gameplan, even if it only exists in major U.S. cities appears to be climbing the priority ladder for brands big and small.</p>	Fri Oct 29 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.</p><h3>Merchants Can Mitigate Supply Chain Woes With Extended Warranties</h3><p>This week, Clyde's CEO, Brandon Gell, sat down with PYMNT'S Editor-in-Chief Matt Nesto to discuss how warranty programs can provide merchants with supply chain relief. Mohamed El-Erian, a veteran economist and advisor to Gramercy and Allianz, wrote in the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0fe0d5d0-3d1f-49ae-94b8-894ba0f0d580?accessToken=zwAAAXveMZ6Ykc8P4NXQPR9JrtOUuIlLoPDVgA.MEYCIQCdpAnCFlbmEX6qc4uCCKTlUPpd2DBxasZDQJIYH_-gBAIhAMPRE2bqjyRO66yHViMpAho1qg3HxIRdSMZuxRp7WjwU&sharetype=gift?token=84f9c43b-ae5b-486b-9960-a5e0aac3f46ff46f">Financial Times</a> last week that supply chains issues will linger globally for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/09/13/supply-disruptions-will-be-with-us-for-at-least-a-year-allianz-el-erian.html">1-2 years</a>, which is bad news for both merchants and consumers. What this means specifically for eCommerce retailers is that repairing products instead of replacing them is suddenly a much more attractive proposition to customers because of the time implications (a turnaround time of days vs. months). To hear Gell explain how Clyde facilitates quick repairs, watch the video below. </p><div></div><h3>User Generated Content Driving Trust and Loyalty Between Brands and Consumers<br></h3><p>The surge in online shopping has created opportunities and challenges for brands in nearly equal proportion. The economic opportunity is clear as more people are shopping online than ever before. And that digital migration from in-store purchasing activity to online was accelerated by COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns imposed by countries across the world. eCommerce revenue jumped by 20% from 2019 to 2020 and economists are predicting that retail eCommerce revenue will pass the $500 billion mark in 2022, which would represent a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272391/us-retail-e-commerce-sales-forecast/">16% jump from 2020 figures</a>. &nbsp;<br></p><div></div><p><br></p><p>The eCommerce spike has brought more consumers to the table, which makes vying for their attention the top priority of brands. What may seem like a simple challenge can quickly spiral into an expansive menu of outreach options. From email outreach and social media targeting to SEO strategies and experiential marketing tactics, it can be difficult to create the right tactical mix. <br></p><p>One cost-friendly strategy that is being valued more and more by Gen Z consumers is user generated content. A <a href="https://stackla.com/resources/reports/post-pandemic-shifts-in-consumer-shopping-habits-authenticity-personalization-and-the-power-of-ugc/">new data report from Stackla</a> indicates that today’s consumers want brands to provide them with more authentic, personalized shopping experiences. The survey of more than 2,000 consumers found that 83% of people believe retailers need to provide more authentic shopping experiences, and 70% say it’s important for brands to provide them with personalized experiences.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:85%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614a3e47716c7cfc08b320eb_Stackla%20UGC.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>‍<br></p><p>“The majority of respondents indicated that user-generated content (UGC) resonates as most authentic, with nearly 80% saying UGC highly impacts their purchasing decisions, making it 8.7x more impactful than influencer content, and 6.6x more influential than branded content in consumers’ eyes,” wrote <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/survey-reveals-that-ugc-can-drive-improved-trust-and-loyalty-for-ecommerce/606801/">Megan DeGruttola </a>of Social Media Today. <br></p><p>She continued, “with online shopping, people can’t physically see, touch or try on the items they’re considering. They want to know how a jacket fits on someone with a similar body type, what that shade of lipstick looks like on someone with their skin tone, or how much space a couch takes up in a living room that has similar dimensions to theirs. UGC offers people an unvarnished, and trusted, third-party view on these unknown elements, helping to bring products to life for them in ways that feel real and relevant.”<br></p><p>To learn more about user generated content and its impact on customers and specific industries, check out DeGruttola’s full deep-dive <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/survey-reveals-that-ugc-can-drive-improved-trust-and-loyalty-for-ecommerce/606801/">here</a>. </p><h3><strong>All In On Malls</strong></h3><p>With the pandemic shutting down in-person life, thousands of retail stores closed up shop. Yet some retailers actually see an opportunity for growth by moving into American malls. Let's go to the mall with the NPR Podcast "The Indicator."&nbsp;</p><div></div><p>For more on this subject, check out our recent post "<a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/livestream-shopping">Meet You At The (Virtual)&nbsp;Mall: An Intro To Livestream Shopping</a>."</p><p>‍</p>	Tue Sep 21 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.</p><h3><strong>Perfecting Your Phygital Experiences</strong><br></h3><p>The word “phygital” refers to the blending of the physical and the digital world. For eCommerce companies this execution of this idea remains critical. <br></p><p>“As the separation between physical and digital continues to blur, retailers are throwing out traditional ideas about the role physical locations play in the customer journey. Stores are becoming inspiration hubs and fulfillment centers as much as they are purchase points, and eCommerce touchpoints, such as apps and websites, are becoming crucial facilitators for all stages of shopping,” wrote Nicole Silberstein of the RFID Journal. <br></p><p>"Where we're moving to, it's not going to be siloed into physical and digital," says Matt Maher, the founder of technology-focused consultancy &nbsp;<a href="https://www.m7innovations.co/">M7 Innovations</a>. "It's going to be one customer experience, and [shoppers] are going to want what they want, when they want it, wherever they want it." <br></p><p>Key to success will be the ability to offer a unified, seamless flow, from online to brick-and-mortar and back again. That means having one system of record for customer data that all other systems can tap into, according to Emily Pfeiffer, a senior analyst at Forrester.<br></p><p>"[Store] retailers and digital businesses still talk about the experiences they create as if they are two separate things," Pfeiffer states, "but customers don't think about it that way. [Consumers] have an experience with a brand or a retailer—it's all tied together, whether they're in an app, in a store, online, talking to someone or calling. And if they have an interaction in one channel that the next channel is unaware of, they feel like they're not understood, not respected by that retailer. That omnichannel view of understanding is terribly important."<br></p><p>In our series, "Growth Reimagined: eComm Strategies That Work, <strong>No</strong> <strong>Lease</strong> <strong>Required</strong>," we featured a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman">pair of articles</a> detailing the value of Pop-Up locations for eCommerce retailers, and how they can bridge the phygital gap.

According to Lauren Thomas of CNBC, “Nike slashed its fiscal 2022 revenue outlook Thursday because of the temporary bottlenecks plaguing the logistics of its business.” As a result, &nbsp;The sneaker giant indicated on its most recent earnings call that it will be decidedly more strategic about where it’s stocking its merchandise, while accelerating it’s direct-to-consumer push. <br></p><p>“It now takes Nike roughly 80 days to get goods from Asia to North America, which is double pre-pandemic transit times. Manufacturing facilities across Vietnam are beginning to reopen, but Nike has lost about 10 weeks of production due to pandemic shutdowns. About 43% of its total footwear and apparel units are made in the country,” wrote Thomas last week. Nike executives told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nikes-revenue-pinched-by-supply-chain-disruptions-11632434721?mod=e2tw">Wall Street Journal</a> that the company’s inventories heading into the holidays are low and it will take several months to get back to full production. The company is shifting some production out of Vietnam and using air freight to avoid bottlenecks at ocean ports.</p><div></div><p>“As long as inventory is constrained, it’s fair to assume the pivot to direct will be accelerated,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Simeon Siegel said on CNBC. “They’re prioritizing their own channels with product first.” </p><p>To learn how Clyde is assisting eCommerce companies facing supply chain issues, click <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/merchant-innovation/2021/merchants-can-mitigate-supply-chain-woes-with-extended-warranties-clyde-ceo-says/">here</a>. <br></p><h3><strong>Split Testing Your Product Prices: Lucrative, Crazy or Both?</strong></h3><p>The eCommerceFuel podcast welcomed Adam Kitain and Drew Marconi to discuss product pricing and split testing.

Check in on this weekly “conversation” to read, watch and listen to stories that are shaping the eCommerce industry.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>The Rise Of Experiential Retail</strong><br></h3><p>The eCommerce industry has been turned on its head in the past 18 months. After COVID nearly brought the entire US economy to its knees, economic conditions have generated two simultaneous phenomena: the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/11/955697672/entrepreneurship-on-the-rise">meteoric rise in entrepreneurship</a> and the rapid consumer migration from in-person to eCommerce spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>As a result, eCommerce competition has never been more pronounced. So how can you compete when you’ve already optimized your operations to provide consumers with the lowest prices possible? According to <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/how-rei-is-building-an-outdoor-ecosystem-around-its-customers/605606/">Retail Dive’s Cara Salpini</a>, the answer is with experiential retail services.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“The rise of experiential retail has led to stores increasingly offering various services, classes and events within their walls instead of just commodities. Greg Portell, lead of the global consumer practice at Kearney, pointed to cooking classes at the likes of Sur La Table and Williams Sonoma, or gardening classes hosted by Home Depot and Lowe's, as examples of some of the more community-focused or educational events retailers have begun holding.”<br></p><p>In our recent series, “Growth Reimagined: eComm Strategies That Work, No Lease Required,” we provide eCommerce companies with suggestions for how they can create experiences for their customers out in the real world. Our two part series on Pop-Up Shops lays out <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up">eight examples</a> of how an eRetailer can get into the in-person experience game.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6130e4d6f5f88576b242cb99_Pop-Up%20Artwork%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up">The Art of the Pop-Up</a> breaks down the three reasons these experiential marketing tactics work:&nbsp;exclusivity, scarcity and hyper-personalization.</figcaption></figure><p>Salpini singled out how REI, an American retail and outdoor recreation services company, has really embraced this experiential angle. “Through REI, a given customer can: test out camping for the first time using the company's rental services, schedule a virtual outfitting appointment for their next camping trip to figure out what kind of tent and cooking gear they need, buy the tent from REI's used business to cut back on costs, buy the cooking gear new because they're feeling fancy, start planning a Yellowstone camping trip, attend a virtual session on backpacking in Yellowstone to pick up some tips and, finally, book their 6-day Yellowstone camping trip through REI.”<br></p><p>If you’re interested in learning how you can bridge the experiential gap, check out our interview with the Creative Director of The Pop Up Shop Agency, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman">Hope Newman</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Nextech AR and Kohls Expand Augmented Reality</strong><br></h3><p>One of the positive business trends to come out of the COVID era has been customers' increased willingness to purchase items without seeing them in person. Historically, sectors like furniture, kitchen appliances and exercise equipment have relied heavily on in-store sales. The tactile nature of these products made it difficult to fully port that purchasing experience online. But with the help of augmented reality, consumers now have the opportunity to view products within the context of their own homes.&nbsp;</p><div></div><p>‍<br>Nima Sarshar, Chief Technology Officer of Nextech and founder of Threedy.ai, recently spoke to the media about the impact AR is having on major retailers like Kohls. "When 3D eCommerce solutions are done right, the results can be incredibly rewarding. Not only financially, but also the joy of seeing your product used by millions of customers practically overnight. Our ability to use our AI pipeline to create 3D models at scale is a real value proposition for large retailers like Kohls" Sarshar commented.<br></p><p>Evan Gappelberg, CEO of Nextech, was also quick to point out AR’s potential to reduce returns, while increasing customer satisfaction. “Kohls is an example of a large retailer that quickly recognized the potential for WebAR to enhance its online business. Augmented reality in eCommerce cannot only drive sales, but reduce customer returns as the buyer feels a higher level of product familiarity before placing the order - the latter being a key point for many eCommerce customers. By combining Threedy’s disruptive AI technology and our leading AR platform, large retailers like Kohls can reach the necessary scale critical to support their ecommerce business.”</p><p><br><br></p>	Thu Sep 02 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

(Another, more common one is <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/article/What-does-cage-free-really-mean-exactly-7249746.php#:~:text=What%20does%20cage%2Dfree%20mean,have%20access%20to%20the%20outdoors.">“cage-free” eggs</a>, since that descriptor doesn’t really tell consumers anything about how those egg-laying chickens were actually treated—they could be cage-free but still kept indoors in enclosures and live pretty miserable lives.)<br></p><p>Greenwashing runs the risk of alienating your consumers when they find out that your practices aren’t quite as squeaky-green as you’d implied, which is exactly what happened to VW.&nbsp;<br></p><p>VW had been touting that their special technology helped their diesel cars emit fewer pollutants for years—but then the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15339250/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vw-diesel-emissions-scandal/">EPA found out that over 11 million cars</a> worldwide had been fitted with “defeat devices” that let the cars cheat emission tests and emit up to 40x more pollutants than the U.S. limit.&nbsp;<br></p><p>VW had to pay a nearly $15 billion settlement, spend $10 billion buying back affected cars, and deal with incredibly negative press coverage.

In a similar way, following a retail-first playbook to pursue eCommerce growth isn’t likely to work. <br></p><p>So, what is the right way to go about it?<br></p><p>Embracing an omnichannel strategy and all of its future-focused marketing avenues.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For our series <strong>Growth Reimagined: eComm Strategies That Work, No Lease Required</strong>, we interviewed growth experts in different fields, all of whom have seen a surge of demand from eComm companies or have built products and strategies specifically to address those companies’ needs:<br></p><ol><li><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-art-of-the-pop-up-redux-insight-from-the-pop-up-shop-agencys-hope-newman">The Art of the Pop-Up, Redux</a></li><li><strong>The Future of Influencer Marketing Is Here</strong></li><li>Meet You at the (Virtual) Mall: An Intro to Social Shopping</li><li>Expos and Trade Shows Are Back—We’ll See You There<br></li></ol><p>We first talked about the "death" of permanent retail spaces and how that has created opportunities for exploration and sales growth via pop-ups. In this installment, we’ll focus on how to leverage real-life communities via influencer partnerships to get all of the brand-building success of retail with less overhead, less complexity, and more control.</p><h2>1. Nano over everything<br></h2><p>Rafael Schwarz is convinced that the future of influence is small. Nano, even.<br></p><p>Schwarz, the Managing Director at <a href="https://www.territory-influence.com/">TERRITORY Influence</a>, Europe’s largest full-service influencer marketing consultancy, explains the different tiers of influencers:<br></p><h3><strong>Celebrity</strong>:&nbsp;</h3><p>These are classic influencers—either those who built a following offline (film, tv, music stars) and brought it online, or those who became bonafide celebrities in their own right via social media. With these kind of partnerships, the focus has been on driving awareness at the top of the funnel, says Schwarz.</p><h3><strong>Micro</strong>:&nbsp;</h3><p>These are smaller accounts with no more than a couple thousand followers, but who enjoy really high engagement (above 10%). Partnerships with microinfluencers is usually focused on driving that highly-engaged audience to purchase or check out a specific brand.</p><h3><strong>Nano</strong>:&nbsp;</h3><p>These are the accounts you probably haven’t heard of, but might have yourself. They are regular consumers, regular people who don’t consider themselves influencers, but who have a few hundred followers online and a real-life circle of friends, colleagues, and neighbors that they interact with regularly. “If you find a way to activate them at scale, it can really help eCommerce stores to grow, because they add this human element we’re all seeking—the social proof,” says Schwarz. “It’s someone like me, not a celebrity, who believes in the product.”<br></p><p>Schwarz and TERRITORY are most excited about nanoinfluencers because they’re entirely authentic. “You can tap into that power, enthusiasm, and credibility by activating thousands of people at the same time. What they lack in quantity of followers, they make up for it if you activate 10,000,” he says. It’s powerful not just because you have 10,000 people sharing something with their 200 followers, but because they’re likely to share their involvement in real life, too, in coffee chats and phone calls and meetups.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Normal people discuss products, services, and solutions that help make life easier,” says Schwarz. “They become <strong>brand ambassadors</strong> in a true sense, and can have a huge impact on sales. That’s where the power of nanoinfluencers lies—<strong>credibility and a chance to actually change behavior</strong>.” Schwarz and his team track this via algorithms that measure not just customer lifetime value, but customer referral value, or how likely someone is to talk to their friends, share recommendations, and drive sales that way.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s an especially novel kind of partnership because you don’t pay nanoinfluencers, explains Schwarz. “You find people who already have a passion for the brand or an expertise in the product category, and you find ways to motivate them intrinsically.” That can be by giving them free product, insider information, opportunities to help others, or other things of value that aren’t cash.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here’s an example of what nanoinfluencers in action looks like:<br></p><ul><li>Rafael loves football (for our American audience, feel free to sub in “soccer”) and regularly hosts watching parties with his friends, replete with lots of snacks (and posts about them)&nbsp;</li><li>A chip brand reaches out to him and asks him if he’d like to join their next ad campaign, and he’s thrilled for the chance to get some free chips and share them with his buddies</li><li>He takes a 10-pack of the newest flavor to their next meetup, his friends are happy, and he’s proud to have gotten to participate&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>“It relies a lot on knowledge, a lot on respect for the person. I want to help them. I want to offer something that’s good for them, and good for their friends,” says Schwarz.<br></p><p>This kind of partnership also gets rid of some of the risk of partnering with major accounts with huge followings. All the due diligence in the world can’t stop an influencer from posting something inappropriate or insensitive and tarnishing your brand—but with 10,000 nanoinfluencers out there, even if a few go rogue, they can get lost in the crowd.&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Influencer-generated content<br></h2><p>The pandemic accelerated the trend towards influencer-generated content, says Schwarz, and now it’s definitely here to stay.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“A lot of marketing departments realized that they couldn’t create any content anymore, and that they needed to open up a second stream of content that is more flexible and agile and <strong>decentralized</strong>, so that it’s not blocked by those big mega events,” he says. “It’s about evaluating influencers not just for quantity of followers, but autonomy of the content they can produce. I expect a lot of brands to do more collaborations with influencers for content production, and not relying on them so much for content distribution. They will not care so much for organic reach, they want to have that content piece that is novel, that is creative, that is engaging.</p><h2>3. Influencer marketing goes with everything<br></h2><p>“eCommerce brands have realized that influencer marketing is much more than awareness driving,” explains Schwarz. “It really can impact purchasing and can be great for consideration, and conversion. The whole trend of social commerce is going to accelerate that.”<br></p><p>That means that adding influencer marketing to other growth-friendly strategies—be it pop-up shops, live events, and social shopping, all of which we’re covering in this series—can exponentially increase your reach and impact.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You can use their original content for future ad campaigns while also driving awareness and conversions via in-app integrations. “Soon, hopefully, it’ll be possible on every social media platform that if you’re an influencer and you’re posting a brand, people can buy that product or service with a click of a button without leaving the platform,” says Schwarz.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Integrations Schwarz expects to see more of:<br></p><ul><li>Events. “It’s something cool they want to show off to their audience anyways.”</li><li>Pop-ups. “Especially for digital brands who want to enable the physical experience if the product can only be bought online. One of the great things I’ve seen like that was a shaving brand that created a traveling barbershop. They invited potential customers and influencers to experience the shave and the experience of a barber at the location they live, and then asked them again to share and talk about that experience online.”</li></ul><h2>4. Next-gen product placement<br></h2><p>Adding a Coca-Cola can to sitcoms’ dinner scenes has been happening for 50+ years. But now it’s not just major brands and top television networks brokering those deals. Influencers are creating productions around their everyday lives, working in ways to showcase products in ways that feel real to their followers.<br></p><p>“If you look at Twitch, most of their partnerships are basically product placements. Streamers are trying to find a way to naturally integrate those products into their livestream, because that’s the only way they can do it, otherwise their audiences will disappear,” says Schwarz, who says he sees the same thing happening with TikTok.<br></p><h2>5. Non-human influence</h2><p>Schwarz is fascinated by virtual influencers, or AI-enabled avatars like Noonoouri, who has 370k+ followers and an IMG Models contract. (She’s also a “proud vegan” despite the fact that she’s fake, made of pixels, and doesn’t eat real food.)</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60e85c3c15ee580b1ee0c08c_Noonoouri.png" loading="lazy"></div></figure><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en">Miquela</a> is another, with over 3M followers, several high-end brand partnerships, and a truly hilarious TikTok about being a robot trying to complete a reCAPTCHA:<br></p><div></div><p><br></p><p>“They collaborate with some of the biggest consumer brands in the world,” says Schwarz. “If you’re all about authenticity, like Dove, that might not work very well, but if you’re a Sony or a Tesla...if you’re a high-tech brand and you’re all about innovation, then collaborating with one of these virtual avatars comes very naturally and could make a lot of sense.”</p><h2>6. Onto niche industries</h2><p>We asked Schwarz to draw some hyper-specific predictions for areas that will be transformed by the above trends. He did some divination for us and came up with:<br></p><ul><li>Highly regulated industries. From alcohol to pharmaceuticals, Schwarz sees huge untapped potential for marketing via influencers, especially unpaid nanoinfluencers. “They’re not allowed to do much else! They’re super restricted, but it’s the company that’s restricted—it’s not one person,” he says. “It’s a flexible way of telling stories that they wouldn’t be allowed to tell in classical advertising.”</li><li>Education. “We’ve all been stuck at home for a year, learning to do things on our own. As consumers, we’d be open and thankful to see somebody take us by the hand and help us find solutions.”</li></ul><h2>What this means for brands</h2><p>Whether you’re a high-end camera company ready to book a shoot with a digital avatar or a small furniture company thinking about inviting microinfluencers to a pop-up showroom, there are endless ways to tap into the brand-building, awareness-generating, and sales-driving power of influencers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And if you haven’t worked with influencers yet—well, there’s no time like the present, is there?<br><br></p>	Fri Jul 09 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
The ins and outs of warranties and product protection	the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection	The Ins and Outs of Warranties and Product Protection	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cc6e217ee39267622e8d378_Learning%20Product%20Protection.jpg	<h2><strong>What are product warranties?</strong></h2><p>A product warranty is a type of guarantee that a manufacturer or merchant makes regarding the current and future condition of its product. Within a service contract provided to the customer, the terms and warranty period are delineated precisely as to define which repairs or exchanges will be made in the event that the product does not function as originally described or intended. Warranties often include consumer protection against product defects and accelerated wear and tear. Consumer products are not required by law to have warranties, but if one is given, it must comply with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and be clear, fair, and enforceable.</p><p>Warranties fall into two separate categories: limited warranties and extended warranties.</p><p>A limited warranty, also known as a manufacturer’s warranty, is a guarantee from the manufacturer of the product that the product will work as intended. There is no additional cost to the consumer. Federal law in the United States requires that limited warranties be available for you to read before you buy a product. Coverage terms for limited warranties vary, but it’s typical to see a one-year limited warranty.</p><p>An extended warranty is an optional extension of the term length of the limited warranty. Extended warranties may be purchased by the consumer for an additional cost, and they are offered and backed by a third party. Extended warranties cover everything included in the manufacturer’s warranty plus additional services such as protection against power surges and wear and tear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The difference between warranties and product protection</strong></h2><p>In the most basic sense, warranties are assumptions of trust that customers make in a product. Warranties work by repaying that trust with a service contract. The service contract is a binding agreement that guarantees replacement or services within the limits of the contract’s terms.</p><p>So yes, merchants can offer warranties too. In order to remove some confusion, this article will refer to merchant-offered warranties as product protection.</p><p>Product protection has been around for years. However, access has traditionally been limited to all but the largest of retailers because of the investment it takes to get started and the potential insurance risk created by smaller product pools.</p><p>The beginnings of InsurTech has been a catalyst to the insurance industry. Digital solutions have allowed insurance companies to become more progressive in how they do business and who they do business with. In turn, product protection plans have become a reliable advantage for all retailers - startup and enterprise alike.</p><p>The first step to understanding warranties is to move past the jargon. Product insurance, warranty, guarantee, extended warranty, product protection and service contract all refer to similar, if not identical opportunities. In the end, there are just two basic categories of warranties; a manufacturer’s warranty and product protection.</p><h3><strong>Manufacturer’s warranty</strong></h3><p>A manufacturer’s warranty is a legal contract that binds the manufacturer to providing repair or replace services. Manufacturers typically have two great reasons to offer warranties:</p><h3><strong>Limit liability</strong></h3><p>Contractually capping potential losses allows manufacturers to accurately estimate the financial impact of a warranty program.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Instill product confidence</strong></h3><p>Warranties have the ability to provide customers with peace of mind from the moment they purchase a product. By virtue of the guarantee, the warranty is assuring the consumer that they’re making a smart financial decision because they can rely on said product for an extended period of time. This empowers the consumer, while increasing the trustworthiness of your brand.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of manufacturer’s warranty:</p><h3><strong>Full warranties </strong></h3><p>These<strong> </strong>meet the minimum standards specified for comprehensive warranties as set by federal law. Full warranties will require the manufacturer to either repair or replace the item if something unfortunate happens.</p><h3><strong>Limited warranties</strong> </h3><p>These do not meet the minimum requirements of a federal comprehensive warranty. This limitation means that these warranties will specify the circumstances under which the manufacturer will repair or replace an item. Most instances are limited to a certain type or malfunction or will exclude damages that are withstood during particular activities. For instance, water damage on a cell phone may not be covered under a limited warranty.</p><h3><strong>Product Protection</strong></h3><p>Product Protection is a distinction made between a manufacturer’s warranty, and a service contract purchased at the point of sale in the form of a product protection plan. These plans are backed by the retailer’s insurance partner. As an umbrella term, product protection plans can include various types of service contracts.</p><p>The intent of product protection is similar to those of manufacturer's warranties. Product Protection Plans aim to improve:</p><h3><strong>Brand Trust</strong></h3><p>Consumers gravitate towards brands that sell high quality products, while providing reliability. Additional coverage in the form of a product protection plan indicates to a consumer that a company is dedicated to providing a high quality experience throughout the life of the product. Brand loyalty is born out of those experiences.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Customer Experience</strong></h3><p>If there is an issue with a product, a product protection plan is an opportunity for a company to engage with a consumer in a meaningful way. Companies that use that opportunity to delight their customers, are well-positioned for the sale with that consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Sales Revenue and Margin opportunity</strong></h3><p>Retaining customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones, and product protection plans have the potential to increase the likelihood of a consumer making future purchases with your company. Additionally, these plans are a financial moneymaker when properly executed. Between the companies and their insurance partner, it can be accurately estimated the margin that can be expected on the sale of each plan.&nbsp;</p><p>One difference between guarantees provided by a manufacturer and those made by a retailer is liability. By offering limited warranties, manufacturers are able to limit their liability against particular types of failure. Outside of merchantability - laws that require new products to be in working condition when received - retailers don’t have the same liability burden. When retailers provide product protection, they are going above and beyond the parameters set in the manufacturer’s warranty.</p><h2><strong>Why product warranties are important</strong></h2><h3>For Merchants </h3><p>In the eyes of consumers, warranties have become synonymous with high quality products. It’s akin to a merchant standing by their product from day one, while also providing a consumer with guaranteed peace of mind. Consumers have also begun to expect guarantees when purchasing items. If they feel secure that they’ll be satisfied with their purchase, they’re more likely to make that purchase in the first place.&nbsp;</p><h3>For Consumers</h3><p>Any purchase, large or small, comes with a bit of trepidation about the period of time one can enjoy the item. Product warranties provide consumers with peace of mind and a feeling of security.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why product protection is important</strong></h2><h3>For Merchants </h3><p>Merchants achieve two critical objectives with product protection plans. The first is passive revenue generation. Crafting carefully worded contracts and working with insurers is a sure-fire way to generate additional revenue over time. The second objective is that these plans strengthen relationships with consumers. A protection plan covers more than a basic product warranty and can leave a consumer feeling supported and confident in their purchase. It also can be offered at purchase or post purchase, which facilitates further interaction between a consumer and a brand. And finally, whether it be a one, two or three year warranty, set time-horizons create natural opportunities to reconnect with a consumer over time.&nbsp;</p><h3>For Consumers</h3><p>Protection plans have evolved in two meaningful ways in recent years on the consumer side. The first is that consumers have better tools to access and fully understand their plans. This makes them more likely to unlock the full value of said plan. And secondly, plans are not cost prohibitive. In many ways, these plans help provide the final push needed to commit to a purchase by locking in long term value in the mind of the consumer.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Types of product warranties Warranties versus product protection</strong></h2><h3><strong>Full warranties </strong></h3><p>A full warranty promises the consumer that the manufacturer or seller will repair the item for free during the warranty period. If the company can't fix the problem in a reasonable number of attempts and in a reasonable amount of time, it has to give the consumer a refund or replace the item.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Limited warranties</strong></h3><p>A limited warranty, also known as a manufacturer’s warranty, is a guarantee from the manufacturer of the product that the product will work as intended. There is no additional cost to the consumer. Federal law in the United States requires that limited warranties be available for you to read before you buy a product. Coverage terms for limited warranties vary, but it’s typical to see a one year limited warranty.</p><h3><strong>Express warranties</strong></h3><p>An express warranty is an agreement by a seller to provide repairs or a replacement for a faulty product or component within a specified time period from date of purchase.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Implied warranties</strong></h3><p>An implied warranty refers to assurances, both written or verbal, that a product is fit for the purpose intended and conforms to an ordinary buyer’s expectations. This is the standard set in place unless the sale is identified with the phrase "as is" or "with all faults.”</p><h2><strong>Types of product protection</strong>&nbsp;</h2><h3>Repair or Replace</h3><p>Replace contracts work well with everyday items that may be relatively low in price. Most cell phone warranties will replace a damaged cell phone instead of trying to repair the damage.</p><p>Meanwhile, repair contracts are better fit to those items whose worth, either intrinsically or in dollars and cents, is greater than the cost of labor. For example, a Steinway piano may be one item worth repairing.</p><h3>Plan Duration&nbsp;</h3><p>A common reason for purchasing product protection is to extend the benefits of a warranty beyond the manufacturer’s warranty period. This is why protection plans are commonly referred to as extended warranties. With a partner like Clyde, customers have the option to choose the protection plan duration. At Clyde, duration options can range from one, two, three or five years of service for higher ticket products.</p><h3>Simple Product Protection&nbsp;</h3><p>Product Protection in its simplest form requires some explaining. These plans do not cover that magical time between product purchase and receipt. Life happens, items break. Simple product protection works well if the item being insured is covered by a manufacturer warranty, because the manufacturer will cover merchantability. So the manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that new items perform as new items should when delivered. In this case, adding a protection plan will extend the coverage duration and may even expand coverage options, giving the customer greater peace of mind.&nbsp;</p><h3>ADH Product Protection&nbsp;</h3><p>Accidental Damage from Handling (ADH) Product Protection plans also extend the duration of coverage beyond the manufacturer’s warranty. Unlike simple protection plans, ADH plans begin at the time of purchase. The added benefit is in the name, any accidents from damage or handling are covered if the plan was purchased before that damage happened. Matching the coverage start date with the time of plan purchase means that merchantability is insured, which further reduces the retailer’s liability.</p><h3><strong>Who can offer product warranties and product protection?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Here are just some of the merchants currently utilizing Clyde to facilitate product protection plans:</p><ul><li>Consumer electronics</li><li>Furniture</li><li>Commercial furniture</li><li>Jewelry</li><li>Appliances</li><li>Commercial appliances</li><li>Bicycles</li><li>Mobile Phones</li><li>Tablets</li><li>Computers</li><li>Televisions</li><li>Sports Equipment</li><li>Outdoor Equipment</li><li>Auto Parts</li><li>Audio Equipment</li><li>Musical Instruments</li><li>Drones&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Are product warranties transferable?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Yes, product warranties can be transferable between individuals.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Is product protection transferable?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Yes, there are protection plans that are transferable between individuals.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why product warranties and product protection are important marketing tools&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The cost of customer acquisition continues to increase year-over-year, and traditional measures like advertising, email marketing and social media marketing are rising in cost and dropping in effectiveness. One of the hidden benefits of a product warranty or protection plan is that it serves as a communication tool with your current customers. As plans are set to expire, merchants can use warranty information as a way to re-engage with their customers. As a result, merchants with comprehensive and technology-enable warranty programs report lower CAC costs than those that do not.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Product warranty management software</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Clyde leverages multiple partnerships to bring a robust catalog of coverage options, facilitating extended warranty at the date of purchase, warranty extension plans, accidental damage coverage at the date of purchase, and limited warranty and limited warranty extension programs. Our platform was designed to provide a simple and transparent insurance experience for your business, your team, and your end-customers.</p><h1><strong>What to expect&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>More than ever consumers are looking for markers of trust, in both brands and in the products they sell. Two-thirds of US consumers are looking for <a href="https://socialmediaweek.org/blog/2018/02/lack-trust-costs-brands-2-5-trillion-per-year-study/">greater transparency from merchants</a>. There is a clear gap between what the industry is providing and what customers are yearning for. According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/">Statista report</a>, 88% of retail shoppers will abandon their carts, a figure that has climbed by nearly 15% in just the last two years. Offering product protection that clearly sets customer expectations is one way to inform and nurture them past that final barrier to purchase.</p><p>Customers are able to choose what they pay based on the duration of coverage they want covered. For example, one year of protection will be cheaper than three years of the same protection. As an added bonus, coverage offers the potential of added revenue if and when the product is damaged and needs service. These “nice to have” features are quickly transforming into widespread consumer expectations and many times prove to be the differentiator between a sale and a lost customer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br><br></p>	Mon Apr 29 2019 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese
The Metrics that Matter	the-metrics-that-matter	The Metrics that Matter	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e931ab64882401e7556921c_Blog-Metrics.jpg	<p>In today’s retail environment, implementing low effort, high return initiatives that drive revenue and customer experience is critical. Hands down, launching a product protection program should be one of those initiatives. As with any initiative, it’s important to consider how you will measure the success of this program and which key performance indicators (KPIs) you should optimize for. Which metrics matter? Which potentially obfuscate the ones that do? Here’s a guide to the metrics that matter, and the questions you need to ask potential partners to make an educated decision.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>1. Attach Rate<br></h3><p>A key performance indicator of any product protection program is the <strong>attach rate</strong>. The attach rate tells you what percentage of orders were purchased with an extended warranty or product protection contract. A typical e-commerce attach rate for consumer brands is 4%, though this varies by industry vertical. Over the past few years, as programs have become more transparent and customer friendly, attach rates have increased. Most retailers using Clyde see rates in the double digits. (Read more about our customers’ success <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/customer-stories">here</a>.)<br></p><p>There are multiple levers a partner should be able to use to help optimize your attach rate, including customizable calls to action and automated margin adjustments.<br></p><h3>2. Revenue<br></h3><p>This one is pretty self explanatory. You should be able to track the amount of revenue you have made over the course of your program without requesting a report from your partner or another department. If a vendor offers a post-purchase program, be sure to ask if revenue can be broken out between time of sale and post-purchase, giving you deeper insight into where you are generating the most revenue. Also make sure to ask how much work is required on your part to activate any of these features.<br></p><h3>3. Your Profit<br></h3><p>Be sure to fully understand how your profit is calculated, and what your expected profit margins should be. There are three components that drive this: 1) The cost of the contracts you’ll sell to your customers, 2) The “service fees” or “transaction fees” charged by the provider, 3) The price at which <em>other</em> retailers are selling the same types of contracts. Ideally, you should be optimizing for 1) Low contract costs, 2) Low premiums, and 3) the most gross margin possible. Make sure you check to see if your provider is charging you transaction fees on your contract costs or retail price.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>4. Contract Sales<br></h3><p>Another pretty straightforward metric, contract sales are simply the number of product protection contracts you have sold over a period of time. Once you have enough data, you will be able to see trends in seasonality and better forecast future contract sales. Be sure to ask any potential partners for benchmarks for companies similar to your own. Automated pricing optimization will not be possible without prior examples of businesses in your industry.<br></p><h3>5. Claims Response Time<br></h3><p>Claims response time tells you how long it typically takes a partner to adjudicate a claim. This is a key part of the customer experience, and reflects on you as a retailer. Make sure a partner has a strong process in place for claim adjudication—because your customers need you most when something goes wrong.<br></p><h2>Watch Out!<br></h2><h3>Claims Approval Rate<br></h3><p>The claims approval rate is the number of claims approved divided by the total number of claims submitted. While it should always be the goal to ensure customer satisfaction, the claims approval rate of a vendor does not necessarily provide helpful information. Many claims are submitted during the limited warranty period, and would thus be denied by an <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/warranties-101">extended warranty partner</a>. However, this does not mean that the customer has not been helped and that they will not receive a repair or replacement of their product, it simply means that the retailer will manage this claim under the terms of their limited warranty. What <em>does</em> matter is how these situations are handled to ensure every customer has an effortless experience. If a customer does file a claim during the limited warranty term, Clyde’s platform offers customers a warm handoff to the retailer's support team.<br></p><p>While claims approval rates may seem valuable on the surface, be sure to dig into the reasons why claims are denied or approved.<br></p><h3>Over-Emphasis on Automated Adjudication&nbsp;<br></h3><p>Auto-adjudication is important, but it’s not the only part of customer communications that matter during the adjudication process. How does the warranty partner handle situations where additional narrative is required to properly assess a claim? How do they manage communications In situations where claims are denied due to the reported issue being covered under your Limited Warranty? During the adjudication process, is your customer success team provided visibility into the claims resolution to provide a better customer experience? These are just a few of the questions you should be asking when digging into <em>how</em> your partner manages claims and ultimately your customer relationships when they need you most.<br></p><h3>Customer Account Access&nbsp;<br></h3><p>Although it isn't a metric, it's easy to get lost in the numbers without getting a real-time virtual tour of what one of your customers would experience if they needed to use the protection plan they purchased from you. After all, they'll associate that protection plan with your brand, so make sure to get a live demonstration of that experience to ensure you're fully satisfied.<br></p><h2>Key Takeaways<br></h2><p>A product protection platform should ultimately do two things for your brand: drive incremental revenue and improve the customer experience. Any KPIs you track should point towards these north star goals. When evaluating whether a product protection platform is a priority for you, be sure to understand which performance metrics you are optimizing for, and which a potential partner can track for you. We hope this list of KPIs will serve as a guide and help you to approach any metrics with a skeptical mindset. </p><p><br></p>	Mon Apr 13 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	maddie-buras

Replatforming was the constant thing, just by the necessity of web technologies,” explained Dr. Ferrari.</li><li><strong>Early 2020s</strong>: application programming interfaces (APIs) have enabled a permanent shift to headless commerce, giving retailers a way to add extra features without having to redo their entire site—and a path to keep capitalizing on mobile-first shopping. "You see all the commerce platforms being influenced by the headless trend and providing better API capabilities because there's just a greater desire to deliver innovative shopping experiences," said Dr. Ferrari.<br></li></ul><p>Retailers are no longer asking themselves whether they should build their own platforms or buy off-the-shelf solutions. Their credit cards are out, and buying is happening.<br></p><p>But to what extent? When is endless customization and personalization and innovation worth the cost?<br></p><p>Blissfully’s <a href="https://www.blissfully.com/saas-trends/2020-annual-report/">2020 report on SaaS app use</a> across over 1,000 companies found that:<br></p><ul><li><strong>The cost to buy is going up</strong>: Companies are spending 50% more on SaaS products, year over year</li><li><strong>Tech stacks are getting more and more complex: </strong>Companies are using 30% more unique apps, year over year; the average enterprise used 288 apps in 2019!</li><li><strong>Prices are outpacing the number of new apps:</strong> Whether they’re adding more users (and thus user fees), upgrading to higher-cost versions, or simply dealing with app vendors who are raising their fees, companies are spending more money even when they’re not adding more apps</li><li><strong>There are still significant (and expensive) costs of disorganization, failure, and churn: </strong>Less than 70% of the apps companies bring on in a given year are still in use the next year, and companies are paying for, on average, 3.6 duplicate apps and 2.7 orphaned app subscriptions<br></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.modernretail.co/sponsored/how-e-commerce-tech-is-creating-a-hidden-tax-for-businesses/">Modern Retail reported</a> on the rising “eCommerce tax,” or the percentage of gross merchandise volume spent on things like cybersecurity, cloud migrations, and retail services.<br></p><p>The average business spends 8.2% of revenue on tech spend, and for eComm retailers, that number is even higher, coming in at 13.3%. (And it doesn’t need to be: industry experts say that up to 30% of tech spend is wasted.)<br></p><p>That means a business that clears $10 million in sales is paying $1.3 million in the tech that supports it.<br></p><p>Tech spend and eCommerce taxes will only keep rising, according to the experts, because it’s hard to have clear visibility into exactly what you’re paying across each app, each subscription, and each plug-in.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Understanding what you’re buying—and why</strong><br></h3><p>Going back to our example from the beginning, Jason of Doe Lashes shared the 13 apps he most recommends for running an eComm site, which included everything from building a custom reviews system (<a href="https://www.okendo.io/">Okendo</a>) to running email and SMS campaigns (<a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/">Klaviyo</a>).<br></p><p>Each one falls into his framework, helping to answer one of his three key questions:<br></p><ol><li>“Can we get people to come back by driving better experiences” (and drive up customer retention rate)?</li><li>“Can we do things on a website to increase the chances of someone to make a purchase” (and increase conversion rates)?</li><li>“Can we do something on our website to make people want to buy more items” (and increase AOV)?<br></li></ol><p>But even when apps meet those goals, they can still be hard to manage—and have questionable ROI.<br></p><p>There are plenty of good things that come from a fully-bought tech stack, including scalability, customization, and increased functionality. But they come with pain points and costs, too, including:&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li><strong>Increased tech spend and churn.</strong> “Sometimes [apps] don't talk to each other, and that's the sad part because you end up having to use a lot more apps to make [it work,] so eventually, your app list just becomes longer and longer,” said Jason. “I’d like to see more apps work with each other rather than against each other if they're offering different stuff. And making sure that they're able to sync their data across each other to help the merchant at the end of the day.”</li><li><strong>Additional security risk.</strong> For each employee that’s using each app, companies are introducing risks of weak passwords, loose security settings, account sharing, and complicated deactivation protocols, per <a href="https://www.blissfully.com/saas-trends/2020-annual-report/">Blissfully</a>. That’s on top of having to deal with national and industry regulations around data privacy, which are harder to follow when you have more apps than you can stay on top of.</li><li><strong>Worse customer experience.</strong> If you’re not careful, adding on a glut of microservices can end up slowing down load time and complicating checkout processes, meaning that for all your best intentions, your tech stack isn’t serving your bottom line.<br></li></ul><p>What can we learn from this?<br></p><p>The importance of (1) being judicious about bringing on new apps and services (like by making sure they pass a decision framework, a la Jason’s); (2) tracking spend and access over time, to better manage bloat and security risk; and (3) getting creative about aligning app functions with costs—and more on that in the next section.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>What to do with rising tech costs and rising product costs</strong><br></h3><p>Spending more on the tech that enables your eComm store is one thing.<br></p><p>Spending more on the tech that enables your eComm store <em>while also facing unprecedented high product costs</em>? That’s something entirely different.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As we <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/6-creative-ways-retailers-can-deal-with-supply-chain-nightmares-this-holiday-season">covered last month</a>, the combination of pandemic and climate-change related supply chain interruptions has the cost of making, acquiring, and selling goods skyrocket. They can either pass those costs onto consumers, with higher prices and shipping costs, or they can freeze prices where they are and take a haircut on those margins. Neither of those are a great option.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s not a good time to see tech stack costs rising. If a company that has 150 apps right now will have 225 by this time next year, they need to start asking themselves one question—a pared-down version of Jason’s framework: will this app be cash-flow positive?<br></p><p>Clyde is an example of an app that brings money in. It costs nothing to use upfront, and retailers only pay a small part (their part of the premium) for each Clyde-enabled product protection plan they sell. Offering extended warranties can help <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/increasing-margin-and-aov">drive up your margin</a> without needing to spend more on your products or reworking supply chain. In essense, Clyde is a cash-flow-positive app that bolsters your business from the moment you launch.</p><p><br><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Ask for a demo today</a> to see what the tech stack of the future looks like today!</p>	Fri Nov 12 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
The Science Behind Social Selling	the-science-behind-social-selling	The Science Behind Social Selling	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/620faed5eb43d2d176bc82c5_Sciene-Behind-Social-Selling-1%20(1).jpg	<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/">Seventy two percent of all Americans</a> use social media, per Pew Research. That number spikes even higher in the under-30 cohort, as you may expect.<br></p><p>But one cohort has them beat: companies. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10796-021-10106-y">83% of B2B companies</a> are on social media, per a 2021 literature review.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And why wouldn’t they be? Social media is the great democratizer. (At least, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768319934/senate-report-russians-used-used-social-media-mostly-to-target-race-in-2016">most of the time</a>.) No matter whether you’re an enterprise or a SMB, you can get your message out on social media. And done well, posting on social media can connect you to a passionate community of would-be brand advocates and buyers.<br></p><p>Companies use social media for two main purposes:<br></p><ul><li>To <strong>build brand awareness</strong>. That’s your traditional <strong>social media marketing</strong>: posting content designed to get in front of as many people as possible, so that they can learn about your company and its offerings. This goal is usually owned by a marketing team.</li><li>To <strong>generate revenue. </strong>That’s what <a href="https://learn.g2.com/social-selling">the industry is calling</a> <strong>social selling</strong>, or the practice of forming relationships with prospective clients and selling to them. This goal is usually owned by a sales team.<br></li></ul><p>You know about social media marketing; that’s not new. Here, we’re going to look at the rise of social selling, covering why it works, what it looks like, and how to get started doing it.<br></p><h1>What is social selling?<br></h1><p>Social selling is using social media to form relationships with prospective customers.<br></p><p>We asked Ashley Scorpio, Vice President of Partnerships at Hawke Media, who joined our <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/walking-the-roadmap-with-hawke-medias-ashley-scorpio">Walking the Roadmap podcast</a>, to explain how she sees SMBs using social selling:<br></p><ul><li>“It’s not just the typical social media marketing, promoting, shameless plugs of your products or your brand,” she says. “It’s also not the advertising, or paid ads when you’re promoting deals or products.”</li><li>It’s about having a “baseline presence, a uniform look and feel” to your business’s online engagement.</li><li>At the end of the day, it’s “good old-fashioned sales: relationship and rapport building, through social media channels,” which can include community management, too.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>It might sound obvious—you see brands doing it all the time. Social selling shows up as:<br></p><ul><li>B2B salespeople and brands regularly posting on LinkedIn and tagging other people—or companies—in their comments, like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregjameskelly_zapier-experts-directory-activity-6897240982174228480-6vSr">this post</a> where a Zapier leader asked for partner relationship management (PRM) recommendations, a peer of theirs tagged Magentrix, and Magentrix’s brand account responded, providing helpful advice.</li><li>Big businesses responding directly to consumer on Twitter—not for customer service (though that happen too), but to engage with their customers and build relationships, like <a href="https://twitter.com/akillerbeauty/status/1490711384581148672">this exchange</a> from Wendy’s about getting more jelly flavors.</li><li>Small business filming TikToks answering FAQs, like <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@starfallcandleco/video/6941111336336248069?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id7052451670039987718">this video</a> of a candlemaker taking viewers behind the scenes of their production.<br></li></ul><p><strong>Social selling </strong>stops short of <strong>social commerce</strong>, or when consumers make purchases on a social media platform. (Like an influencer or a brand linking products shown in an Instagram post and their followers being able to buy them without leaving Instagram. Or like a brand hosting a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/livestream-shopping">livestream shopping</a> event.)</p><h1>Why is social selling popular now?<br></h1><p>Consumers get more outreach than ever before. (We explored the declining returns on email marketing in <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-touchpoint-trojan-horse">our whitepaper “The Touchpoint Trojan Horse.”</a>)<br></p><p>And during a socially-distanced pandemic, when the only way to make new relationships or to foster old ones was through virtual connection, we got used to spending more time online. It’s quite possible to form meaningful connections online—<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782916300021">this literature review</a> explores the positive psychosocial effects of online social interactions—and brands are starting to recognize that.<br></p><p><a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/as-ad-spending-picks-up-brands-need-to-balance-awareness-and-activation-strategies/">Nielsen reported</a> on brands pulling back on digital channel spend in 2020, including big players like Adidas, and focusing more on “balancing brand building with sales-driving initiatives.”<br></p><p>Social selling is just that. That’s why Ashley told us that she thinks social selling is the future:<br></p><p>“I think social selling is key, and I also think it’s the way forward. We noticed once the COVID-19 pandemic really hit in 2020, that a number of the major platforms started to roll out specific tools to enable better social selling and experiences – both for the brands and businesses, and their customers.”<br></p><p>Social selling is especially popular now, in the aftermath of pandemic-induced changes to how we communicate, shop, and connect. But we were already trending in that direction, and the last two years have just accelerated the journey. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00913367.2019.1588808">Dutch study</a> published in 2019 asked media agencies about how brand communication in social media has changed. They pointed out that:<br></p><ul><li>Social media is now full of “blurred lines between brand communication and other content,” where native advertising, content marketing, and social selling all overlap.</li><li>For years now, social media content has needed to be “less ‘commercial,’ but more organic and relevant.”</li><li>Ad campaigns are now “‘social first,’” meaning that all marketing campaigns start with anticipating social activation.</li><li>While social selling is currently focused on closing deals and converting buyers, we’ll likely see social media applied to other parts of the sales cycle, “such as need recognition, awareness, consideration, and evaluation.”</li></ul><h1>Why does social selling work?<br></h1><p>Social selling works because social media works. We do create relationships there, we do use it for recommendations, and we do trust information we get from social media.<br></p><p>That’s especially important because digital ads aren’t as effective as brands would like to believe. In 2021, the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/what-digital-advertising-gets-wrong#:~:text=The%20effectiveness%20of%20digital%20ads,up%20a%20number%20of%204%2C000%25."><em>Harvard Business Review</em> reported</a> that brand search ad effectiveness was overestimated by 4,100% for eBay ads and 4,000% for Facebook ads.<br></p><p>Let’s look at a few scientific studies to see exactly how social selling can positively impact brand performance—and sales:<br></p><ul><li>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/20932685.2018.1461022">study that surveyed</a> 277 users of the Victoria’s Secret Facebook page found that user-generated content found on the brand pages, especially peer recommendations and social support (comments, likes), can have “significant positive effects” on consumer trust of brands.&nbsp;</li><li>A <a href="https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJMC.2018.095129">study that looked</a> at the use of Snapchat by college-aged consumers found that in 2018, Snapchat was considered the most intimate, casual, and dynamic platform. That perceived intimacy between consumers and brands on the platform means that companies who advertise on Snapchat can see their audience’s intent to purchase increase.&nbsp;</li><li>An <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/APJML-10-2017-0267/full/html">analysis of 10,750 branded social media posts</a> in Indonesia found that interactive branded posts get more responses than informative messages. That means that community activation—like asking questions, sharing quizzes, or soliciting input—is a better social selling tool than solely posting about your products.</li><li>A <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/4/1167/htm">study of 1,598 Twitter posts</a> found that consumers don’t expect larger companies to “talk to” individuals on social media in the same way that they expect SMBs to, and that when enterprises do use social selling, consumers value it more than they do when SMBs engage in the practice. But since consumers trust SMBs more, on average, those businesses can have great success using social selling to convince customers to purchase their product.<br></li></ul><p>Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter…there’s no shortage of social media platforms that can be used for social selling, and while each one requires a slightly different approach, the overall equation for success is the same.</p><h2>The formula for success in social selling is…</h2><p>An <strong>authentic, intimate tone + customer-first messaging + community activation</strong>.</p><h2>An example: social selling on LinkedIn</h2><p>If you have a LinkedIn account, you’ve probably seen examples of that platform’s own version of social selling. LinkedIn recently <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/sales-solutions/cx/21/pdfs/the-state-of-sales-2021-report.pdf">shared data</a> about how salespeople use its platform:<br></p><ul><li><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/social-selling/the-social-selling-index-ssi"><strong>78%</strong></a> of social sellers outsell their peers who don’t use social media&nbsp;</li><li>People with complete LinkedIn profiles were <strong>twice as likely</strong> to meet or exceed their sales targets</li><li><strong>82% </strong>of buyers are more likely to consider a brand if their salesperson has an informative LinkedIn profile</li><li>Salespeople who conduct <strong>15 lead searches</strong> on that platform per day are reaching their quota twice as fast—and social selling leaders are <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/social-selling/the-social-selling-index-ssi"><strong>51%</strong></a> more likely to reach quota<br></li></ul><p>LinkedIn has even come up with a tool to measure individual people’s sales success, called its <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/social-selling/the-social-selling-index-ssi">Social Selling Index</a>.

Luckily for me, I don’t use LinkedIn for lead generation!&nbsp;</p><h1>How can I get started with social selling?</h1><p>If your brand has any social media accounts, you probably already do some social selling. Here are some ways that your branded accounts can be more purposeful towards that goal.</p><h2>5 ways brands can practice social selling<br></h2><ol><li><strong>Set up social listening alerts. </strong>Google alerts can inform you when customers are mentioning your brand, giving you the opportunity to either solve problems (with your customer service team) or look for a sale.</li><li><strong>Try shoppable quizzes. </strong>This form of content, says Hawke Media’s Ashley Scorpio, is a great way to get to know your customer and build useful, first-party data on what they’re interested in, which can then inform future product decisions.</li><li><strong>Share user-generated content (UGC), especially testimonials and reviews.</strong> Reviews are more important than ever, says Ashley, since customer consideration periods are getting longer. (Her company’s data showed consumers starting to research Christmas presents in April!) “Looking at UGC, you’re seeing that what you actually get looks like the beautiful, well-lit product shots the brands are pushing out on their channel and through ads,” she says.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use social channels to distribute content marketing.</strong> Turn your blog posts or ebooks into short, shareable posts, infographics, and Tweet threads to maximize your content ROI and to provide a steady stream of interesting, educational content to your audience.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be cognizant of your response time, and other metrics. </strong>Facebook has rolled out new tools to provide transparency to consumers on how businesses use their platform, including a response time metric and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/475643069256244">accompanying badge</a> earned by companies whose response time is 15 minutes or less. Know what metrics are visible to your consumers and work to keep them favorable.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2>4 ways individual salespeople can practice social selling<br></h2><ol><li><strong>Join groups relevant to your target audience on platforms like Facebook andLinkedIn and participate.</strong> If you’re a salesperson for an outdoor retailer, for instance, you could join hiking affinity groups. Don’t constantly name-drop your company’s products, but do engage authentically with questions and posts in the group so you can come to be seen as a trusted source of information.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Regularly like, comment, and share other people’s content. </strong>These “lighter” interactions don’t come across as overbearing or interpersonal, but do get your name on the newsfeeds of prospective clients.</li><li><strong>Post on a schedule. </strong>It doesn’t have to be the same time every day, but you should be regularly posting. Some sales professionals suggest scheduling a 30-minute block every day to post, comment, and otherwise engage with your professional social media platforms.</li><li><strong>Optimize your account to sell</strong>. Make sure your profile photo is a good headshot and that your company is tagged in your bio. You want to ensure your prospects see you professionally, not personally. You can also sign up for business engagement tools, like Instagram’s suite of business tracking metrics.</li></ol><h1>See you on the sales floor</h1><p>Whether you’re running a small business or an international brand, you can’t ignore the impact of social media on your sales goals.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br>For another way to drive revenue, consider offering product protection with Clyde. <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Schedule a demo</a> today.</p>	Tue Feb 15 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
The Sustainability Of The eCommerce Spike	the-sustainability-of-the-ecommerce-spike	The Sustainability Of The eCommerce Spike	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/60c24b7c1bb5337faa4b8202_E%20Commerce%20Boom%205.jpg	<p>The pandemic blew expectations for eCommerce growth out of the water. What really happened, and what does it mean for what’s next?</p><p>Raise your hand if it’s news to you that 2020 was a banner year for eCommerce.<br></p><p>*Looks around, sees no hands raised.*<br></p><p>Glad to see we were all paying attention.<br></p><p>But while it’s easy to understand why eCommerce jumped the way it did—we were all staying home to avoid a deadly disease; those of us lucky to be at home had more disposable income to spend; the internet became our dear friend—it’s worth digging into how exactly that happened and what the industry is expecting for the future.<br></p><p>We’ve done that for you. Here are the highlights:<br></p><ul><li><strong>What did the eCommerce spike look like around the world? </strong>In 2020, a full 19% of global retail sales were made online, per <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/05/1091182">UN economists</a>, with the biggest spikes happening in the UK (where eCommerce accounts for 23% of all sales) and China (25%). The U.S. is at 14%.</li><li><strong>Will the spike peter out or stay strong? </strong>Even as the CDC says we can take masks off and employers are starting to return to offices, the shift to eCommerce looks to be a permanent one. For example, Walmart recently <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/media-library/document/q1-fy22-earnings-presentation/_proxyDocument?id=00000179-7c09-d966-af7b-7c6fcfe40000">shared their first quarter numbers</a> and reported a 37% growth in net eCommerce sales in Q1, even compared to pandemic spikes in the same time period last year. That growth was driven, said the company, by increased interest in store pickup and delivery services as well on online marketplaces, suggesting that omnichannel retail is here to stay and will only help, not hurt, eCommerce sales in the long run.</li><li><strong>Where is the industry heading and what is it doing with all this extra interest and profit? </strong>The pandemic-fueled acceleration into eCommerce has pushed forward technical innovation in the space. Per research firm CBInsights’s <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/retail-tech-trends-q1-2021/?utm_term=report-download&utm_campaign=marketing_state-retail_q1_2021-05&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=127201549&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-83JcWo0s3kLyJesUlbdB0t8WCbkf8Qd5QpjH1WbAEAFeb_VjDLDUXYaYnAA9caDHYgxN3r1lRJ8uLeXDCwxm4T3_yy0A&utm_content=researchpublic_state-retail_autosend&utm_source=hs_email">Q1 report on retail tech</a>, funding to eCommerce tech grew 73% compared to the prior quarter and now represents nearly $12B of investment in spaces like checkout, cybersecurity, and virtual try-ons, among others.<br></li></ul><h2>What did the eCommerce spike look like around the world?</h2><p>eCommerce grew its market share in major economies around the globe, per the <a href="https://unctad.org/news/global-e-commerce-jumps-267-trillion-covid-19-boosts-online-sales">UN</a>, including:<br></p><ul><li>Australia, where online retail accounts for 9% of retail sales</li><li>Canada, 6%</li><li>China, 25%</li><li>South Korea, 26%</li><li>Singapore, 12%&nbsp;</li><li>United Kingdom, 23%&nbsp;</li><li>United States, 14%&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Of the top 13 B2C eCommerce companies, 11 of them are from China or the United States. While a few travel companies have managed to hang on to top spots, their rankings dropped as companies offering things like grocery and niche marketplaces overtook them:<br></p><ol><li>Alibaba, grossing $1.15T</li><li>Amazon, $575B</li><li>JD.com, $379B</li><li>Pinduoduo, $242B</li><li>Shopify, $120B</li><li>eBay, $100B</li><li>Meituan, $71B</li><li>Walmart, $64B</li><li>Uber, $58B</li><li>Rakuten, $42B</li><li>Expedia, $37B</li><li>Booking Holdings, $35B</li><li>Airbnb, $24B<br></li></ol><p>And while GDP and big, multi-national corporations saw eCommerce booms, so did smaller businesses. Whether retailers had always been online-only or, like <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/texas-inc/article/The-pandemic-forced-retailers-to-focus-on-16177948.php">Houston chocolate shop Cacao &amp; Cardamom</a>, had to adapt into an eCommerce company on the fly, more customers with more disposable income has been a boon for smaller retailers, too. (That chocolate shop now drives 70% of sales—compared to 10% last year—from eCommerce!)&nbsp;</p><div></div><h2>Will the spike peter out or stay strong?<br></h2><p>eCommerce started out as retailers with unique products finding their market fit on an ever-expanding online marketplace. Then it evolved to being about the platform for finding and delivering those products (thanks in no small part to players like Amazon, and later Shopify and the like). Now it’s a vertical of its own, with eCommerce players owning their own product development, distribution, delivery, and marketing, and truly competing with established brick-and-mortar stores across all industries.<br></p><p>And the recent <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-impact-of-covid-19-and-accelerated-4288334/">40% spike in eCommerce due to the COVID-19 pandemic</a> may have accelerated the role eCommerce plays for consumers, but it didn’t artificially inflate it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s hard to give customers something new and convenient and then take it away. Even when it’s safe to be milling around big box stores sans masks and strictly regulated capacity limits, many customers will stick with the convenience of buying things online. EY’s <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/future-consumer-index">Future Consumer Index</a> found that 80% of U.S. consumers are still changing the way they shopped and plan to continue doing so.<br></p><p>That’s true even for retail segments that previously seemed impervious to online competition (like grocery shopping).&nbsp;<br></p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.producebluebook.com/2021/04/19/u-s-online-grocery-sales-for-march-2021-up-43-vs-year-ago/#">Q1 report from Produce Blue Book</a>, a research agency focused on the grocery segment, U.S. online grocery sales were up 43% for March 2021. Average order values have stayed up, monthly active users have remained constant, and order frequency has gone up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And while some segments of the grocery eCommerce market have suffered—home shipping is down, for instance—those changes can be explained by corollary spikes in retailer-owned delivery mechanisms, with buy-online-and-pick-up-in-store options spiking along with direct delivery options. (For instance, H-E-B, a Texas-based grocery chain, <a href="https://abc13.com/shopping/h-e-b-makes-curbside-grocery-services-free/10651839/">just announced</a> that they are making curbside pickup services permanently free.)<br></p><p>As of March 2021, 62% of online grocery buyers were likely to use that service again.<br></p><p>And technology is evolving to enable even more people to participate in eCommerce across industries, from groceries to consumer technology and more.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The World Economic Forum just put out a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/05/technology-help-unbanked-access-ecommerce/">report</a> on how the pandemic-related shift away from cash and towards digital payments is locking out 1.7 billion adults worldwide who do not have access to bank accounts, and how pioneering financial solutions, from biometric authentication to hybrid buy-online-but-pay-in-cash models, are getting those buyers online.&nbsp;<br></p><p>More customers, more convenience, more competition—we’re calling it: the spike is here to stay. <a href="https://business.adobe.com/resources/digital-economy-index.html">Adobe’s Digital Economy Index</a> expects global eCommerce to hit $4.2T in 2021, and U.S. eCommerce to hit $1T in 2022. We wouldn’t be surprised if that happens even faster.&nbsp;</p><div></div><h2>Where is the industry heading and what is it doing with all this extra interest and profit?<br></h2><p>eCommerce isn’t just about eCommerce anymore, argues a recent <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-e-commerce-fits-into-retails-post-pandemic-future"><em>Harvard Business Review</em> op-ed</a>; instead, “the future success of retailers will ultimately depend on creating a cohesive customer experience, both online and in stores.”<br></p><p>Looking at where major players are investing and what the M&amp;A trends suggest, that point is supported. Across the board, retailers who already have their ecomm fundamentals in place are looking to evolve the experience of the digital shopping journey, meeting customers as soon as they start consuming content with highly personalized, big-data-enabled outreach.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let’s return to the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/retail-tech-trends-q1-2021/?utm_term=report-download&utm_campaign=marketing_state-retail_q1_2021-05&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=127201549&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-83JcWo0s3kLyJesUlbdB0t8WCbkf8Qd5QpjH1WbAEAFeb_VjDLDUXYaYnAA9caDHYgxN3r1lRJ8uLeXDCwxm4T3_yy0A&utm_content=researchpublic_state-retail_autosend&utm_source=hs_email">CBInsights State of Retail Tech Q1’21</a> report for more detailed insight on some of those trends:&nbsp;<br></p><ul><li><strong>Investment in ecomm is winning the day. From digitizing traditional stores and creating more engaging online experiences to cutting fulfillment time and finding ways to make shipping more eco-friendly, retail tech is putting its money where its mouth is. In the first quarter of this year alone, 14 new retail tech unicorns entered the scene, mostly in the ecomm niche, and ecomm tech funding jumped 73% to reach $11.7B.&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Big deals for online delivery and marketplaces abound. Three of the five highest-valued new ecomm unicorns are focused on streamlining online ordering and fulfillment (Weee!, an online grocery platform in the U.S.; Getir, a 10-minute delivery platform in Turkey operating a dark-store model; and Dutchie, an online marketplace for marijuana dispensaries in the U.S. and Canada), and a whopping 73 mega-fundraising rounds (deals worth &gt; $100M) in Q1 focused on those areas.</strong></li><li><strong>Ecommerce growth is spurring growth in related fields. “Fraud protection and consumer data privacy will be increasingly important as a significant portion of consumer spending lives online,” hypothesized the CB team, who found that retail-focused cybersecurity tech came in at $1.8B in Q1.</strong></li><li><strong>Ecommerce giants give a glimpse at future growth. Want to know what Amazon thinks the future of ecomm looks like? Just look at their balance sheet. In the first quarter of this year, Amazon acquisitions included Australia- and India-based ecomm platforms to help them compete with other ecomm players in those markets; the company also invested in electric delivery vans and on-demand beauty and spa services.</strong><br></li></ul><p>To recap, all these trends prove the points we explored above: eCommece’s growth is a global phenomenon, it’s here to stay, and it’s driving towards innovation at every stage of the sales funnel and every part of productization and platforming.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The way buyers find products online will only continue to evolve. So will the ways they try on products, buy products, pay for products, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">protect products</a>, get rewarded for their purchases, and share their purchases with their networks.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On the industry side, the way retailers find customers, serve them advertising, gather data on them, protect their purchases, and build customer loyalty will all change, too.<br></p><p>The arms race continues, and we’ll be right here, tracking it with you.&nbsp;<br></p>	Thu Jun 10 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

The Trust Doctrine: What the Data Says Matters Most for a Successful Extended Warranty Program	the-trust-doctrine-what-the-data-says-matters-most-for-a-successful-extended-warranty-program	The Trust Doctrine: What the Data Says Matters Most for a Successful Extended Warranty Program	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/615f3793f64db741e73c7741_Survey-Results-1.jpg	<p>The path to a successful product protection plan is paved with data.<br></p><p>Retailers are collecting more information on their customers than ever before. They know which CTAs drive purchases and they know where on each webpage they’re likely to lose buyers. They can A/B test different product descriptions, sales offers, and marketing flows to figure out what works best for their exact audience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And consumers are on board with targeted marketing. A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail">2020 McKinsey study</a> found that 80% of customers <em>want</em> personalization from retailers.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But when it comes to the product protection space (also known as the extended warranty space; we’ll cover those semantics later on), many retailers don’t have the expertise to dive into the minutiae of marketing and branding options.<br></p><p>That’s why <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Clyde’s product protection platform</a> comes with built-in, AI-enabled best practice software that suggests prices and CTA placements. And it’s also why we partnered with <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/">PYMNTS</a>, a global leader for data and insights on all things commerce, to conduct an in-depth survey on how consumers engage with product protection plans.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We wanted to equip retailers with the information they need to implement extended warranty offerings that <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/solve-customer-satisfaction-with-customer-experience">increase customer satisfaction</a>, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/how-to-grow-average-order-value-post-purchase">drive up average order values</a>, and <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/10-ways-for-retailers-to-improve-customer-lifetime-value-ltv-clv">enjoy higher customer lifetime values</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Read on for:<br></p><ul><li>An overview of our survey methodology&nbsp;</li><li>The #1 thing that matters to consumers when it comes to product protection</li><li>Which types of consumers are most likely to consider extended warranties, and on what types of products</li><li>What language and branding works to convert which type of consumers<br></li></ul><h2>By the numbers<br></h2><p>Our PYMNTS / Clyde survey went to 2,519 qualified respondents who took a median time of six and a half minutes to complete it, which means we had more than 272 hours of captive attention from a core audience that looks a lot like the general U.S. population:<br></p><ul><li>Gender: 51.5% women&nbsp;</li><li>Average age: 47.3 years old</li><li>College-educated: 32.3%&nbsp;</li><li>Income: 36.1% &gt; $100k, 30.9% $50-100k; 33% &lt;$50k<br></li></ul><h2>Trust issues—and trust opportunities<br></h2><p>We asked respondents who purchased durable goods in the last few months what made them decide to purchase or not purchase product protection.<br></p><p>Both answers came down to one thing: <strong>trust.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Isn’t that interesting?&nbsp;<br></p><p>For consumers who did buy product protection, their <strong>number-two reason</strong> for buying it was because they <strong>trusted the company offering the protection to follow through. </strong>(The number one reason? That they worried they’d break the product. Understandable!) A full <strong>38% </strong>of respondents listed that as the reason they made the purchase.<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft" style="max-width:30%"><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/what-shoppers-look-for-when-buying-online" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614497bc03e535a329ee5970_E%20Commerce%20Boom%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a><figcaption>Clyde's latest report detailing "What Shoppers Look For When Buying Online"</figcaption></figure><p>But for customers who <em>didn’t</em> buy product protection, <strong>it also came down to trust. </strong>This time around, it’s a two-part story. First, the main reason people didn’t buy a protection plan is because they believed that the standard manufacturer’s warranty was all they needed (<strong>53%</strong> of respondents). Said otherwise: they trusted that the product would work as intended and that the manufacturer would have their back if it didn’t.<br></p><p>Another leading reason, though, clocking in at number three with <strong>19% </strong>of respondents listing it as the reason they didn’t buy product protection when it was offered, is that they <strong>didn’t trust the plan to cover repairs or replacements.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>What do all of those results tell us? Marketing extended warranty or product protection plans can be a dual-edged sword. You don’t want to suggest that your product will break, or that a manufacturer’s warranty on it won’t be enough. But you do want to ensure that your customers know that in the case that something <em>does</em> happen, a product protection plan will cover them entirely.&nbsp;<br></p><p>When it comes to communicating that, what we’ve seen work with Clyde clients is giving specific examples. For instance, a protection plan that included accident protection would cover you if you dropped your ereader in the pool and it stopped working—even though the manufacturer’s warranty wouldn’t apply, because it wasn’t being used as intended.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Money matters<br></h2><p>You’ve heard the adage “you’ve got to spend money to make money,” right? Well, it may be true that sometimes you have to spend money to save money, and not everyone is able to do that.<br></p><p>Our survey with PYMNTS found that two things were true when it came to money and product protection plans:<br></p><ul><li>Consumers were <strong>over two times as likely</strong> to buy an extended warranty if the original product purchased <strong>cost $500 or more</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>Over <strong>half</strong> of consumers who consider extended warranties for every purchase have high annual incomes<br></li></ul><p>If a consumer is already dropping $1,000+ on an item (average amounts spent by our respondents included $1,011 on jewelry, $1,236 on exercise equipment, and $1,960 on mattresses, for example), it makes sense that they’d rather spent a little extra to ensure that their investment was protected in case anything happened.<br></p><p>Retailers can incorporate that kind of messaging into their marketing around protection plans, and they can also look for extended warranty programs (like Clyde’s) that come with automatic pricing tools to make sure that they’re protecting their margin while also giving customers the best deal possible.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And if you sell big-ticket items and aren’t already offering an extended warranty, you’re leaving money on the table—and leaving your customers stressed, too.<br></p><h2>What’s in a name? Quite a bit, actually&nbsp;<br></h2><p>Throughout this article, we’ve used the terms “product protection plan” and “extended warranty” almost interchangeably. They’re not quite the same thing—<a href="https://docs.joinclyde.com/docs/protection-plans-101">product protection usually includes accident coverage, for one</a>—but we’re trying to make a point in using both: different audiences react differently to each term.<br></p><p>Do you feel like one is a better deal than the other?<br></p><p>What year were you born?<br></p><p>Here’s what our survey found:<br></p><ul><li>Young consumers are much more likely to be interested in “extended warranties”</li></ul><ul><li><strong>50.3% of Gen Z buyers</strong> say they’d be interested, versus only 36.7% when “product protection plan” is used</li></ul><ul><li>Millennials and bridge millennials (currently aged 32-41) will go for either, though slightly prefer “extended warranty”</li></ul><ul><li><strong>48.6% of bridge millennials and 51.4% of millennials</strong> would be interested in an extended warranty, compared to 46.0% and 47.2% for a product protection plan</li></ul><ul><li>Gen Xers will go for either, too, but Baby Boomers far prefer “product protection plans”</li></ul><ul><li><strong>30.2% of Gen Xers would be interested in a product protection pla</strong>n, vs 28.1% who would be interested in extended warranties</li><li>For Baby Boomers, it’s almost double: <strong>13.1% would be interested in product protection</strong> and only 8.6% in extended warranties</li></ul><ul><li>Every generation except for Gen Z <strong>would be more likely to spend more money with a retailer if they were offered a “product protection plan” </strong>versus an “extended warranty”</li></ul><ul><li>Only 22.1% of Gen Zers would spend more in that case, though 45.6% would spend more if offered an extended warranty</li></ul><ul><li>And when it comes to other subgroups, people who are especially interested in coverage plans to protect expensive purchases are more likely to go for “product protection plans” than “extended warranties”:</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Consumers with lower education levels prefer product protection</strong> (81%) to extended warranties (70%)</li><li><strong>Consumers with children have the same preferences</strong> (70% versus 58%)<br></li></ul><p>Remember what we talked about in the beginning? Marketing successfully means using personalization to create unique buying experiences for different audiences. That means using their preferred language, too.<br></p><p>Perhaps your on-site and post-purchase communication highlights extended warranties on products that are most often bought by younger consumers, but uses product protection language everywhere else.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Maybe your CTAs on family-friendly furniture buys talk specifically about how the protection plans you offer have consumers’ back in the face of accidents or spills.<br></p><p>Knowing your customers helps you figure out what they need—and how you can market your products, including a product protection plan, to fill that gap.<br></p><h2>Giving you what you need to succeed<br></h2><p>We know how important data is to a retail business.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You need to know what’s selling, who’s buying, and how it’s all going.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That’s why Clyde’s purchase protection software comes with a built-in analytics dashboard that reports on key stats and overall success.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And it’s why we partnered with PYMNTS to look at how trust, pricing, and terminology impact customer experience and your bottom line when it comes to extended warranty options.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Want to see more of the nitty-gritty? <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Reach out to our team</a> for more insight from the survey or for a free, custom demo to see how Clyde can start driving revenue in minutes.</p>	Thu Oct 07 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

They’re a key part of sales and marketing strategies because they help push consumers further down the funnel, going from awareness (Lean more!) to interest (Sign up for a free trial! Ask for a demo!) to sales (Buy now!). After you’ve caught a consumer’s attention, a CTA tells them exactly what to do with it. Think of them as digital breadcrumbs. <br></p><p>I come across so many calls-to-action in my day-to-day life because I come across so much advertising in my day-to-day life.

This is used most often by established brands who have already invested in ad strategies to get you to try their products and now just want to remind you that those products exist, and by new-to-the-scene brands establishing their aesthetics. They rarely contain direct CTAs. </li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Reminder advertising</strong>, where the goal is to spur a repeat purchase or form a habit. Most PSAs fall into this category, as do timely advertisements focused on sales or seasonal offerings.&nbsp;</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Persuasive advertising, </strong>where the goal is a general one: influence customers to take a certain action towards a new brand. These are where CTAs are the most prevalent and obvious. They tell customers exactly what the brand wants them to do: try a new product, remain loyal to an old one, switch brands, or share their experience.</li></ol><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:714px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/604666afdda5713446b3ad32_kW-PQ9yIvCU1BoNNzyBRoAqMh_jbyv6vI6rxwoq9ybRstl9pue1ZGfoWp5TgkjRHpbsXkZLOaac5Hs7DUZioakKSULAogE6jBOJBReAp9PiZrRe8CC5V8v7m-Q9vta_uTBGkA0B0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div><figcaption><em>These Amazon call-to-actions recognize that I’m early in the process of considering either product.

Every once in a while on our blog, we’ll feature a business that’s crushing the customer service game and analyze their strategy. This week we’re highlighting the popular ecommerce retailer, Zappos.</em></p><p>Two battle-tested approaches to customer service are the Amazon and Zappos methods. Both have been highly effective, and it’s become clear that there isn’t a singular way to achieve customer satisfaction. Amazon <em>and</em> Zappos consistently claim some of the most satisfied customers in ecommerce.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e19b16ec9935a9f01d3d_5b4e0a16d521cc44e4a406d8_zappos.png"></div></figure><p>While Amazon aims to make their customer service as streamlined as possible, helping customers resolve their issues in the fewest clicks possible, Zappos shines because of their efforts to build relationships with customers.</p><h5><strong>What Zappos is doing right</strong></h5><p>CEO <a href="https://blog.smile.io/top-10-best-customer-experiences" data-rt-link-type="external">Tony Hsieh likes to tell people</a> that Zappos’ is a customer service company that <em>happens</em> to sell shoes (and more). This attitude is emblematic of their intensively customer-first approach to doing business. </p><p>What does this look like in action?</p><p>In one <a href="https://blog.smile.io/top-10-best-customer-experiences" data-rt-link-type="external">famous Zappos story</a>, they sent the best man at a wedding a pair of shoes with expedited shipping free of charge after the original pair he ordered got misrouted in the mail, thus ensuring he didn’t go barefoot to the celebration. In another <a href="https://customerthink.com/5-companies-with-envy-worthy-customer-experience/" data-rt-link-type="external">legendary Zappos customer service tale</a>, the team hand delivered a traveler a pair of shoes from a rival shoe store free of charge after the woman realized she had forgotten hers at home and was disappointed to find Zappos no longer sold them. After both of these episodes, Zappos had undoubtedly created a customer for life.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5cb8e19b16ec99204df01d3c_5b4e0a9925d7fb83cca57b38_zappos2.jpeg"></div></figure><p>Both of these examples of Zappos going above and beyond came down to the company’s ability to establish a connection between a member of their customer service team and one of their customers. Developing these types of relationships is nearly impossible without human interaction. That’s why, though it may seem archaic, Zappos relies on the telephone as their weapon of choice. Their phone number is proudly and obviously placed on each page of their site.</p><h5><strong>Why it matters</strong></h5><p>Zappos’ obsession with building positive relationships with their customers is perhaps their greatest driver of success. </p><blockquote>Every call or interaction represents an opportunity to “wow” someone, to turn a one-time buyer into a loyal, repeat customer, thus ensuring future business.</blockquote><p>Companies that take the Amazon approach to customer service can be successful because they aim to make the process as simple as possible. On the other hand, companies that take the Zappos approach can market or leverage the care they offer their customers as a value-added service, thus giving them an edge over competitors.</p><h5><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h5><p>While the Amazon approach lacks the human touch, it's nonetheless efficient, requires less labor, and is therefore less costly to operate. The Zappos approach, on the other hand, makes a business’s customer service program a more valuable and marketable asset. Businesses should be thoughtful about their customer service program and consider which approach to customer service is right for them.</p><p>‍</p>	Wed Aug 08 2018 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jacob-stein

Or in other words, once you get a customer in the door, how much is that relationship worth over time?&nbsp;<br></p><p>For context, a <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/225415">2013 book on marketing</a> estimated CACs across various industries to be the following:<br></p><ul><li>Travel: $7</li><li>Telecommunications: $315</li><li>Ecommerce: $10</li><li>Financial: $175<br></li></ul><p>If you use a travel site like Priceline to book a $200 flight that nets Priceline $20 in commissions but never return, that $7 CAC suddenly doesn’t seem so cheap. By comparison, a cell phone provider may spend over $300 to get you as a customer, but they often keep you as a customer for years and years. Those $75/month service fees and pricey equipment upgrades, net the provider thousands of dollars over time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>CAC has grown massively over the last few years for a few reasons:<br></p><ol><li><strong>More channels to make content for. </strong>You’ve have, in no specific order, the following methods and platforms to reach customers:<br></li></ol><ul><li>Your company blog</li><li>Video content</li><li>Social media marketing</li><li>Influencer marketing&nbsp;</li><li>Paid search marketing</li><li>Organic search marketing / SEO&nbsp;</li><li>Email marketing&nbsp;</li><li>Newsletters</li><li>Plus traditional methods like ads for print, TV, and radio; direct mailing; billboards; and sponsorships.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p>Initially, newer channels started were cost effective (read: cheap), so even as the number of channels a merchant needed to be involved in was growing, the budget needed to make an impact wasn’t necessarily ballooning up with it. After all, running an email campaign is probably easier and more affordable than designing, printing, and mailing a catalogue, right? But it’s not quite so simple. Now, creating compelling content involves investing in SEO strategists, copywriters, designers, engineers, and others to get messages made and seen.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And merchants have to maintain many of those channels themselves. Instead of just paying for a quarter-page ad in a newspaper, they now have to pay to host a website, to design interactive content, and to make sure it works. In fact, a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/marketing/insights/articles/gartner-cmo-2020-2021-tech-digital-channels-withstand-budget-cuts">2020 survey</a> of over 400 Chief Marketing Officers found that their biggest spend is, in fact, on technology, at 26.2% of their budget, followed by media (24.8%), in-house labor (24.5%), and agencies (23.7%).<br></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>More products to compete with on those channels, aka more digital saturation</strong>. As customers are inundated with messages across all these new channels, merchants have had to start shelling out the big bucks to stand out. They have to pay more to get the same number of impressions, meaning CAC is rising without necessarily resulting in higher lifetime values or sales.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>High rates of customers opting out due to dissatisfaction, aka higher churn rates</strong>. Play out what it must feel like to be a consumer. Everything you look at, from your social media feeds to the banner ads on your favorite website to your email, is full of people clamoring for your attention. That’s annoying, but also serves to remind you that there are a ton of people out there offering the same product or service with minute variations. If you have a bad experience—whether that’s one too many emails, a faulty product, or a frustrating experience with customer support—you can leave and go elsewhere. Having lost you, the company you just left needs to...go out and spend even more on acquisition costs to make up for that loss.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>Add to that list of CAC-increasing factors a few pandemic-specific disruptions:<br></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Dissolution of previously lucrative channels. </strong>In non-pandemic years, trade shows are usually a hugely important marketing avenue, especially for B2B merchants. With those canceled, and other sponsored events off the table, too, companies are spending more trying to rank for keywords relevant to their audience in order to make up for lost leads and sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li></ol><ol start="5"><li><strong>More discerning customers with tighter wallets. </strong>Both B2B and B2C companies are finding that their customers might not have quite as much to spend this year compared to years past. With U.S. employment still suffering from the pandemic and <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/09/24/economic-fallout-from-covid-19-continues-to-hit-lower-income-americans-the-hardest">33% of all American adults</a> having to dip into savings to pay their bills, bigger marketing budgets don’t necessarily mean more acquisitions if customers can’t afford to be customers in the first place.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>3 ways to offset rising CAC costs</strong><br></p><p>The way we measure CAC is focused around marketing initiatives and how much they cost. But throwing more money at the problem won’t solve it.<br></p><p>The good news: customer acquisition doesn’t have to be shouldered by your marketing team alone. Marketing has other goals too, like generating leads and increasing brand awareness; they shouldn’t be the sole team responsible for driving every customer over the line. What can you be doing with already-existing resources and processes?<br></p><p>Let’s look at three: customer service, sales, and product.<br></p><p>1. <strong>Customer service</strong>: Acquiring customers is good; retaining them is great. Get more value out of the customers you have and keep them around for longer by providing top-in-class customer service. Solve problems as soon as they happen—or even before they happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Extended warranties can help with that. With pre-programmable and fully customizable CTAs that go out on regular cadences post-purchase, you can check in with your customers, gather data about their purchases and what’s working, and immediately solve any problems that come up, capturing a lost sale <strong><em>before</em></strong> it’s lost. Clyde can run all the logistics of your extended warranty program and let you collect on the profit margin. <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Get a custom quote for your business</a>.<br></p><p>2. <strong>Sales</strong>: Your sales team knows how to get your product or service into customers’ hands. They’re good at it. The only people who are probably better? The customers themselves. There’s a reason why word-of-mouth advertising works. Per <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2012/consumer-trust-in-online-social-and-mobile-advertising-grows/">Nielsen</a>, 92% of consumers trust recommendations from friends and family more than any form of advertising. Running a referral program means unlocking that sales potential without having to drop a ton of money on ads or even on salespeople’s salaries; referral incentives don’t have to be extravagant to work.&nbsp;<br></p><p>3. <strong>Product: </strong>Have you ever seen every engineer’s favorite chart about automation? I’ve sat in at least four cubicle farms that had it posted on the wall:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:644px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5fdcc674fd544c93f0e8dcf7_Tbf_jZ8-f_ZXKI9xIxKU9XsTZXUPZ1D2GV0EyIVs2HeYdMOTG37vLclbMkAgbPuqNMLu8x5j0-Ct8wtH1ZH-E9n78OyEk0srBA5wILPo6F6tzITqiMec2e8kLKEHHE4M1L7CipsB.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>What are all of the marketing, customer service, or sales processes that you spend money and time (which is money) on now? How much could you save if you automate them? If your customer service reps do a one-month check-in with each new client that takes ten minutes each time, and they do five of those a day, The Chart would say that it’s worth up to six months of time building an automatic tool that can do the same thing. Use your product talent to invest in internal tools like personalized, automated text messaging campaigns or periodic customer check-ins to capture unrealized sales constantly.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Stop CACs’ meteoric rise&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>While tripling an AdWords budget is one tactic employed by merchants, a holistic approach is far more likely to move the needle in the long run. Building efficient ways to reach new customers, while retaining the ones you already have is a far more effective way to reduce your CAC. Adding an extended warranty program, starting a customer referral program, or automating marketing and customer service tasks are just a few ways to think about these costs in a big picture way. <br></p><p>Questions, comments, or examples of successful tactics that you've employed to combat rising costs?&nbsp;We’re all ears.&nbsp;You can reach out <a href="mailto:michael@joinclyde.com">here</a> or via our social channels below. </p><p><br></p>	Fri Dec 18 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff

Warranties 101: Understanding And Communicating the Value of Warranties to Your Customers	warranties-101	Warranties 101: Understanding And Communicating the Value of Warranties to Your Customers	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e2b25eb60c190b20d285ad4_Warranties_101.jpg	<p>Last week, we hosted a webinar for retailers on understanding and communicating the value of warranties to your customers. Because there is a lot of confusion and misunderstanding about what warranties are and what they are meant to do, we wanted to demystify the term. Here are the highlights from the webinar.<br></p><h3>What are warranties?<br></h3><p>A warranty is a guarantee that a product will function as described and intended. Consumer products are not required by law to have warranties, but if one is given, it must comply with the <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/brief-history-of-product-protection">Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act</a> and be clear, fair, and enforceable.<br></p><h3>What is the difference between a limited warranty, an extended warranty, and an accident protection plan?<br></h3><p>A <em>limited warranty</em>, also known as a manufacturer’s warranty, is a guarantee from the manufacturer of the product that the product will work as intended. There is no additional cost to the consumer. Federal law in the United States requires that limited warranties be available for you to read before you buy a product. Coverage terms for limited warranties vary, but it’s typical to see a one year limited warranty.<br></p><p>An <em>extended warranty</em> is an optional extension of the term length of the limited warranty. Extended warranties may be purchased by the consumer for an additional cost, and they are offered and backed by a third party. Extended warranties cover everything included in the manufacturer’s warranty plus power surges and wear and tear.<br></p><p>It is important to note that not all warranties include accident protection. So if your three-year-old decides to pour juice all over your new computer, a repair or replacement might not be covered. An <em>accident protection plan</em> will ensure that you are covered for drops, spills, and crashes—not simply manufacturer defects.<br></p><h3>Does every product come with a warranty, or do you need to pay an additional fee?<br></h3><p>For the most part, all products come with a limited warranty. However, if you want to purchase coverage for a longer term and/or would like accident protection, you’ll have to purchase an extended warranty.<br></p><h3>Who holds the risk and is responsible for honoring each type of warranty?<br></h3><p>Under a limited warranty, the manufacturer is responsible for guaranteeing the warranty. Under an extended warranty, the third party you have purchased the warranty from is responsible.<br></p><h3>How does each type of warranty function alongside each other?<br></h3><p>This is an interesting one. An extended warranty’s term begins once the manufacturer’s warranty ends. However, extended warranties that include accident protection commence at the same time as the manufacturer’s warranty.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here’s an example:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1170px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5e27715264010fb5a9d5d8fd_Screen%20Shot%202020-01-21%20at%204.43.49%20PM.png"></div></figure><p><br></p><h3>Why do warranties get a bad rap? Is this a mischaracterization?<br></h3><p>Historically, warranties have gotten a bad rap for a few reasons—high fees and deductibles, confusing terms and conditions, and frequent claim denials.<br></p><p>However, extended warranty terms today are much more transparent and consumer friendly. Retailers today are focusing on putting their customers first and offering extended warranties with clear terms and conditions and competitive premiums.<br></p><p>It is important to keep in mind that a typical manufacturer’s warranty does not cover accidental damage to a product. Purchasing accident coverage gives customers peace of mind for situations that are often outside of their control.<br></p><h3>Clyde’s Mission<br></h3><p>Clyde’s mission is to create beautiful, intuitive software that empowers retailers to offer their customers peace of mind with extended warranties and accident protection. By educating retailers about the product protection industry, we hope to give you tools to provide your customers with the same level of transparency.</p><p><br></p>	Thu Jan 23 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	maddie-buras
What Shoppers Look For When Buying Online	what-shoppers-look-for-when-buying-online	What Shoppers Look For When Buying Online	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614497bc03e535a329ee5970_E%20Commerce%20Boom%201.jpg	<p>Whether online or in-store, a bad shopping experience can be memorable for all of the wrong reasons. eCommerce platforms—large stores like Amazon and Target leading the way with small mom-and-pop shops learning from their example—are all battling it out for attention from customers.</p><p>Companies must attract the attention of customers, while also gaining loyalty and positive reviews. The data shows that experienced shoppers are aware of this and prefer some incentives over others. And if eCommerce sites are going to get their target buyer to prefer online shopping to the instant gratification of shopping in-person, they need to sweeten the deal.</p><p>To find out what leads consumers to the checkout page, <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Clyde</a> analyzed data from a survey conducted in 2020 by<a href="https://www.globalwebindex.com/hubfs/Downloads/Commerce%20Flagship%20Report%20-%20GWI.pdf"> Global Web Index</a> among 125,195 internet users aged 16–64. The results showed what they prefer, and what they’re willing to spend more on to get products delivered. You’ll find that cash is still valued and that reward points aren’t just for fancy credit cards. One incentive on this list even involves prioritizing pick-up options.</p><h4>Did You Know?</h4><p>The market for extended warranties is closing in on $50 billion annually.

According to a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1127357/guest-checkout-us-ecommerce-website/">2020 survey conducted by PYMNTS</a>, 59.4% of eCommerce platforms in the United States allow access to the checkout page without creating an account. Only 12.7% of businesses require a profile before checkout, proving its value to the site and the customer. Some survey respondents allowed buyers to get to the cart without an account, but find that once they click “checkout” or “buy,” they have to create an account. This is often a deterrent for those looking for a fast and easy shopping experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While the checkout process seems like an opportune time to entice shoppers with email newsletters sign-upsdetailing promotions and up-to-date information on upcoming sales, the clunkiness of the process can steer shoppers away altogether. Between creating a secure password and verifying an email address, many consumers become frustrated quickly. Having a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/blog/a-moving-target-the-world-of-ctas">streamlined checkout process</a> can be the difference between potential customers emptying their carts.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614498988702f4743ce7c471_yYAGeQqzwg1tXoT8vXMAfEVfdzFMHfynnClQdzi2FvNGiwV5-VLkujIAT3J-o3u884fGXdPN1rGRPPKW6eNAcPK61tKnEM6QRhxgL1EvPEurflvEBUHbEKDbUZKB49rbUZqHKBHX%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#12. Click and collect delivery (tie)</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 15% of respondents</em></p><p>This retail trend is also known as buy online, pick up in-store. According to Inbound Logistics, a <a href="https://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/study-finds-growing-demand-for-retail-click-and-collect/">2017 Click and Collect Retail Consumer Preference Study</a> revealed buyers value this method for several reasons. Among them is not having to wait in long lines—and that consumers can choose their pickup location and often park in a designated spot for a quick in-and-out. Some shops even offer curbside pickup, eliminating the need to enter a store altogether. It’s the next iteration of one-day shipping, but much faster.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6144989851e605261e3b0998_UauuVon_A4rB-Qs90c6xcu35OzUygl2DDe9wy4R0DJx7aYTcgSkaGtTY6BPo_hjKyiFxx70eOyeH-znLbgfJAMAPrPQX545NBtlaTjJp3S6Vpv1jdP0TKZMpQHp4Qvgs3WKI-vUF%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#11. Ability to pay with cash on delivery</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 18% of respondents</em></p><p>It may seem that eCommerce is driving consumers toward a cashless society, but this data point shows that cash still matters. <a href="https://www.ridester.com/does-uber-take-cash/">eCommerce sites and apps</a> like Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats allow buyers to order food without worrying whether they have enough money on their card. The cash upon delivery method was the norm for food delivery before apps, so it only makes sense that this level of convenience continues online.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6144989864b1141199906e72_hxDW8Mr1e8jhGogHfKJlhJXNs2LphJ_P3U_RiBOMgpNBN9DrMLnXpbWgV3Ko8RL5UKe9pUZE6ZlFv7WgdLcx_o_ZyhGuEgcQs_rAt8ACFCApwQzMwB8bts7jdEhEnRQTAy84ao8H%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#10. Ability to spread payments without interest</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 20% of respondents</em></p><p>The number of tools to create a fast and easy checkout process has increased in recent years. There are two major innovations: One-click buying and “buy now, pay later” programs. In-store, the latter is known as “layaway,” but this version has an added benefit: You get the product right away and usually pay it in full via four or five installments rather than paying it off before taking it home. Several eCommerce companies are making inroads on different online shopping platforms, with some examples being <a href="https://www.klarna.com/us/what-is-klarna/">Klarna</a> and <a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-AU/how-it-works">Afterpay</a>.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61449898dfb26dfb7808c405_TIkSusNXMeG4E3BWWfq6B3LcDqi39aJbr-25my4h_9WxQEt24E95ukpLjwKRF33zUIAHxnDqSDthBd8XNTxroW_imQAKCMjpL-AUqruQm6XFSuvqka1x2q6Ht2u7XIzR09Npu9Bk%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#9. Knowing the product is environmentally friendly</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 21% of respondents</em></p><p>Consumers are becoming more socially conscious, far beyond concerns of animal testing. Packaging, in particular, has become a growing concern. While the product itself may be friendly to animals and trees, the bag it’s packed in may not be as friendly to the environment. Beauty product packaging is a concern for shoppers, according to <a href="https://www.beautypackaging.com/contents/view_online-exclusives/2021-08-19/survey-says-consumers-want-their-packaging-sustainable-please/">Dotcom Distribution’s annual survey</a>. Many consumers want to reuse the packaging and if not, they’d prefer that products be packaged in a recyclable box rather than a polyvinyl bag. Companies are also using other buzz words like “clean,” “planet-friendly,” and “100% recyclable” to assure consumers that they encourage sustainability.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61449898cab4be3bfa9453a9_DGzkLNj4_ZHObryRL9i-etcVoCZmMXOSimDfRQuBZF8gBhNADX3sDfJ2DkNxDqmNeN9L_ULIZu5IMsRurIq1PNNzp7Cs56lfG5SE8W-IUfYv_mLPvKV60etzmJ6baoBjHRcLhLMd%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#8. Good comments on social media</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 22% of respondents</em></p><p>Social media has become a place to share every part of one’s life, and of course, this also includes the products consumers like or dislike. Marketing data shows that social media behavior is linked to an increase in purchase activity. According to <a href="https://medium.com/nova-marketing-insights/how-social-media-can-change-your-e-commerce-business-up-and-down-47431a807efe">NOVA Marketing Insights</a>, consumers would rather hear a friend talking about a product than a brand. This is likely the basis for the success of social media influencers and the brand deals they’re offered. Brand deals with social stars make it appear to the consumer that someone’s opinion of a product is genuine since they’ve tried it themselves. What’s sometimes not considered is that these influencers are often paid to say positive things or have been sent free products to review.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6144989864b114e698906eb4_ixQu-jfCXIQgAPwPoCtNFw6OzOSeIEziqOlrXMQBE9Lbe1zvLj76QbkyJAuV_KC4qCnObW5Fzkr4imVrjKpFTYLeFPaIur4oLEoKpjRd3AP2kr9sjDMeNE9KD6HwoUZG-AgBt0yN%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#7. Loyalty points</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 27% of respondents</em></p><p>Loyalty programs have been a go-to marketing strategy for decades. Some programs are based on one annual fee or a store card that gets the buyer discounts. But loyalty points accrue over time—more points equals more rewards. For stores like Target, JCPenney, and Nordstrom, the more customers spend, the more points they can collect. Some offer one point for every dollar spent and some are percentage-based, but they all offer rewards to the buyer for shopping their store. In addition to getting more than they pay for, consumers can <a href="https://www.offers.com/blog/post/best-rewards-programs/">also redeem special gifts</a> after reaching a certain spending milestone—think air miles, but for retail.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614498987a833b669bf725d4_dCO43noip8EkyZ8N-T0L0WXt1ThwxemxXK-Lwql3PXrCMCtFcwz-i1EDEQ9JZGE2Of_1FpldyTODUAMdlnuI-1j124ce6YOoFGqXJkxhcx5F0g1Oa6cJqAajTjNd9q-zXHP6Z0Xb%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#6. Next-day delivery</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 28% of respondents</em></p><p>Order it today, get it tomorrow. eCommerce shoppers seem to be willing to pay for new perks like these, that offer next-day delivery, rather than the standard seven business-day delivery. Why get it in a week when you could get it tomorrow? Stores like Walmart and Best Buy <a href="https://www.offers.com/blog/post/one-day-shipping-stores/">offer next-day delivery</a>, among other brick-and-mortar names. Savings expert <a href="https://www.offers.com/blog/post/one-day-shipping-stores/">Kristin McGrath called Amazon</a> “a trend-setter when it comes to creating new retail norms,” as the company pioneered next-day delivery with success.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614498988580ae6572824486_gdR5PoVMs2PHa2dyhKy-vyKt8JxD68kDOJG9yVWAqg9hJTXfJ4pObFiBVd-wZcfEvBBGlfTO-1P1yV-jye4XWlikL7Z0L-s30J6w1DG_IJJ9hFqCyvzLRBrGNrPA7pxBcolJMiNr%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#5. Quick and easy online checkout process</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 30% of respondents</em></p><p>If buyers don’t have to wait in line at the supermarket and can order groceries online, they definitely wouldn’t want to wait in a virtual line, either. However, this is challenging for both the buyer and the businessperson who runs the shop. What kind of payment service should they offer? How will they streamline it? How can they optimize it for mobile shopping? Jimmy Duvall, member of the Forbes Technology Council, says the main thing business owners are chasing is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/11/19/the-five-most-challenging-parts-of-e-commerce-checkout/?sh=51bcd4aa3b72">cart abandonment</a>. Enticing shoppers to come back is all part of the easy checkout process, and once they do come back, they’ll want to see a page that’s quick to navigate.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614498996ddf9021828556de_jqy1s-yuBxaY3S1z7z8JhqO6FC273YYaR8_6dkrjTbPs8_JEPvjGQ1jWKopsKsem5wBhlRoFjsiXhBxahsoQ9KjSDJZ130sOj3UrA2qMdcZZ-LNb6lXdUtGkaryoICvKU3NM2dOW%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#4. Easy returns policy</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 33% of respondents</em></p><p>The only thing better than an easy returns process is a free one. According to data <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/ecommerce-product-return-rate-statistics/">compiled by Invesp</a>, at least 30% of products ordered on eCommerce sites are returned. If that many customers are returning their products, the process has to be just as easy as buying the product in the first place. Invesp found that 92% of customers will buy again if the returns policy is easy, and 79% of buyers want that process to also be free. That means no questions asked, and no pricey or complicated return labels, either. The tough part is that only less than half of the companies offer free returns.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61449898bce25a5f07b05617_nDcfIF_LPjCkZt9MVKSocAEAE3_nVOQreIQhtGq_4o1ba9SjukiY9HzvNoHPJ-PXwl3StfJtpkkdMYyYqZCS_oeUm-H2uZDfGre2igomXBnln1fYSv1DHvXs36ad9YHJbBzFQQbw%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h3><strong>#3. Reviews from other customers</strong></h3><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 35% of respondents</em></p><p>Finding reviews on the same page as the item customers want to buy is considered highly convenient. Otherwise, customers may leave the site to find reviews elsewhere, which decreases the chances of a purchase. Built-in reviews are usually displayed beneath the product, if not directly tied to other crucial information, like shipping. For many sites, if a shopper's search is specific enough, the average number of stars for a product will appear in the Google result.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614498994c31737251b0a5f9_o82K-jc1oK3Ww9-NFFhtiCI8C5lobigx0l82TNzeqCIqOY1ZesIMpNXI4VV00JX-aYuabW3ShkIFzwavgsyT4kSQVPsgOwZ2f3-mhkyvUOtLXlJZ-SwMAZzfDHcc_Vkk_VzEHSLG%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>#2. Coupons and discounts</strong></h2><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 41% of respondents</em></p><p>eCommerce could be a way to save, so some websites enhance that experience with coupons and countdowns as an incentive. It's not always about getting the deal but finding the customers who are looking for deals. eCommerce experts say that coupons can drive traffic to a site through link building. The <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/ecommerce-coupon-link-building/414868/#close">Search Engine Journal recommends</a> eCommerce sites even dedicate a page to coupons they have currently running. This is to ensure that when shoppers search “furniture coupons” that aggregate sites are not the only result that pops up.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:40%"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/614498999204344dfdd4e9db_HvfpO8BJ1vHwqd0YBPpQ2bkpKAWZfkA-1pq6T7dpWvGMRqprpaXovUKsRW37KvIQYq-xMyqnhGbcf0Nzv4m8hqkQ00VHgcanB-A9um11rlm2w9c9y8AQBvjion9euCKgk4lDkOqG%3Ds0.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>#1. Free shipping</strong></h2><p><em>Increased likelihood of purchase: 53% of respondents</em></p><p>At this point, the only difference between buying products in-store is that buyers don't have to leave their homes. Free shipping nearly levels the playing field by adding no extra cost in addition to finding products online. This perk is key, but Global Web Index notes that this sentiment has fallen among buyers, making additional shipping costs “slightly more acceptable.”</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Photos courtesy Shutterstock users: Alliance Images, Blue Planet Studio, Dr. Victor Wong, Goodluz, Kaspars Grinvalds, Kite_rin, Marlon Trottmann, </em><a href="http://Rawpixel.com"><em>Rawpixel.com</em></a><em>, Robert Mullan, Ronstik, Sean Locke Photography, Tero Vesalainen, VGstockstudio</em><br></p>	Fri Sep 17 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese

Still, it’s an unfortunate reality that products will eventually malfunction, break, or come to the end of their useful life. That’s where product protection plans come in.</p><p>Also known as service plans or extended warranties, product protection plans can cover defects, accidents, or damage to products and even allow consumers to get them replaced or repaired at no additional cost. Product protection plans are most popular for expensive goods like <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/what-to-consider-before-buying-protection-plans">smartphones and laptops</a>. This is partially because they have become so crucial to 21st-century life that it would be difficult to go without your phone or computer while it is being repaired. Of course, not all product protection plans are created equal, and some consumers might wonder if they’re always necessary or just for expensive products like electronics and home appliances.</p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/">Clyde</a> compiled a list of 10 important things to know about product protection plans—from what to look for in the fine print to understanding the average cost—to help you decide whether a protection plan can save you money in the long run.</p><h4>DID YOU KNOW?</h4><p>Clyde offers a wide range of<a href="http://www.joinclyde.com/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-warranties-and-product-protection"> product warranties</a> that can cover any industry. Popular industries that are covered by Clyde include Consumer Electronics, Jewelry, Furniture, Sporting Equipment, and much more.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f4451c1d51d5b242a449_Y7goexwI6F-YY3FvWBr8XWj3M_HUnRSE3OhaWJYyHG56uH1JoqepL88VlwO4VztIUxjAsHnh6XfhKI1b27qOWzuaWoPnjyEOTtGpk6m7FZ9o-exGrvODnwpY3K9FIGI_H_z1okpF.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Protection plans aren’t one-size-fits-all</strong></h2><p>Before considering any extended warranty or protection plan, check the manufacturer’s warranty. Federal law requires that customers be able to <a href="https://abc13.com/extended-warranty-auto-warranties-is-an-worth-it-what-it/5891157/">read the manufacturer’s warranty </a>before making any purchase that costs more than $15. Once you know how long the manufacturer’s warranty lasts and what it covers, you can make sure any product protection plan you’re considering doesn’t duplicate coverage. According to a law adopted by all states, products also come with an <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/05/the-word-on-warranty-protection/index.htm">implied warranty</a>, meaning the item must function as a reasonable person would assume it should for a reasonable length of time.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f44535b3c411b94623e3_CXoZ1Ed2tFKR91OeVXQc5TfFrdH7yd8bOYypYpLB81yHfY69D_zNaTF9xHXvljwsBsU4EL1tA0IODIJenQzHbgoefSU-lo3tlYpgu-z_dSYPHaysj01YeHV24xPN-8_9XhO2f-fe.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>For products built to last, long-term protection plans can represent major savings</strong></h2><p>The longer you expect to own a product, the more it makes sense to invest in long-term protection plans like extended warranties. Take cars, for example. According to Consumer Reports, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-repair/get-an-extended-warranty-for-your-car-a1570471227/">95% of car shoppers rank reliability</a> among their top concerns. Extended warranties are particularly popular for cars, as they can give consumers peace of mind that if something unexpected does happen to their vehicle, the cost of repairs will be covered. If your vehicle does end up needing extensive repairs, an extended warranty would <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/auto/i/extended-car-warranty">reduce your out-of-pocket cost to just the deductible</a>—not the entire bill.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f4454562147090a337d2_quhl0yqyYkSaUlM3BO7eVE-2xa4n_ZDDKUSjwTwDWjP-BGCc9vvdpJ0cq8srORY31sUnuvgG25cCr3tQ8z6UFXfbJkOqx4zxO1SrgXdSw9A0xcaWSMlAFRZRpjvArhJ9tCFeyPSC.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Compare the cost of the protection plans to average repair (or replacement) costs</strong></h2><p>You’ll also want to compare the cost of your monthly payments to the average repair before buying a protection plan or extended warranty. In order for the plan to be a good investment, the yearly cost <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/what-to-consider-before-buying-protection-plans">should be less than the average repair</a>. For example, let’s say you choose to buy a product protection plan for your smartphone that costs $15 per month. If your phone malfunctions after six months and needs a $500 repair, the plan would have only cost you $60 so far. Product protection plans can also be a sound investment if you have a limited budget and would struggle to come up with several hundred dollars to invest in an urgent repair.</p><h4>TRENDING</h4><p>An exceptional customer experience starts with the first purchase. Check out our guide to a <a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/platform/merchant-dashboard-features">merchant dashboard</a> that drives additional revenue each time you sell a product.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f446a1351a0082635b35_SPETe2tuPyyaC0cJD36weI5DCzhvTm9OydfoS_HMa9VQkfwPSBNs4zc2YQT43dGwE9v7c3U-T-ErZz-KJsZ9Csu7XeejotI1GCeUxNwYtXmOR0YMvcTRCvrVFnA-Tddql6b2gpFF.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Always read the fine print for filing and processing claims</strong></h2><p>Most manufacturer warranties, product protection plans, and extended warranties come with a lot of fine print. For instance, some extended warranties for cars require you to <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/auto/i/extended-car-warranty">visit specific shops for repairs</a> or may only pay for a portion of the costs after a certain mileage. Some product protection plans also <a href="https://www.checkbook.org/national/should-you-buy-extended-warranties/">require you to provide plnety of documentation</a> to file a claim, including the original receipt. Even terms you might think you understand can be defined differently. Some warranties <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/05/the-word-on-warranty-protection/index.htm">define a product’s lifetime</a> as the amount of time a product is available from that manufacturer, for example.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f4452460f05127aecb66_mux4HzvkRFew4VKJvCdk5EjFS0uJz3p_65IKkl_QmA9UokNtwBYeeOIhFCMOZ74O7uRVJFU7UNQA3g4P-KRPKVffKnl7kipFAc4xC2WVJeydcaaBVdV4qIsII-urI2C4SZS7PAA_.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>It’s important to weigh the likelihood of product damage that aligns with the plan</strong></h2><p>A product protection plan’s fine print will also go into detail on what kinds of issues will be covered. For instance, some plans <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/spending/articles/what-to-consider-before-buying-protection-plans">exclude repairs caused by accidental damage</a> like spilled liquids—so if you’re hoping to insure your new laptop against damage from your toddler’s juice box, you may be out of luck. On the other hand, some phone carriers offer plans that cover theft, loss, and damage. Once you know what kinds of damages or defects would be covered, consider how likely you are to take advantage of that plan.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f445402c7448a0018b51_mflmSloh6d48m130lbaAUQX-hBWLxni5bwwyG8yBWYPxopRlN-PPGFT25jwTgk7zH8TXXxHVkdmJPi8guYusj3zRAXIr6hmyWvikHV1CFAyexqoUnsSeZXOjzkCY6rNazF5BoF08.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Keep overall depreciation in mind</strong></h2><p>Considering how quickly a product depreciates is a key part of deciding whether to invest in a protection plan. If a product is going to rapidly decrease in value, it might make more sense to simply replace it with a newer, more valuable model rather than spending money to repair it down the line. For instance, <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/car-depreciation">a new car depreciates 20-30% in the first year</a>. Within five years, most cars lose more than half of their initial value. <a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/saving-and-budgeting/articles/2017-09-13/stop-wasting-money-on-rapidly-depreciating-gadgets">Electronics also depreciate quickly</a> because so many new products come onto the market constantly. In fact, every new release causes the price of the previous year’s model to drop significantly—sometimes up to 60%.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f446a06e08587853a6f8_f4HvkKCPeFCGX_79t9avaZ1ShWnx_9_qRmmsksr2Uok7EHNYE4pqulbmwuL50yrtEf9Ok9iDX8QQOr1IXQn1AxZG2xbBF9H8mDap_Szg8PS5lKrufdtweliqL-wFpmqB9RN7bC44.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Protection plans are major drivers of brand loyalty</strong></h2><p>Many of the consumers who choose to buy product protection plans are those brands’ most loyal customers. One market research study found that customers who bought service plans or extended warranties <a href="https://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20170309.html">are more loyal</a> to the retailer than those who didn’t. People who were more familiar with these product protection plans were also more likely to purchase them. Additionally, a separate study found that customers who were very happy about the product they were purchasing were also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/business/08every.html">more likely</a> to opt for an extended warranty. These “hedonic purchases,” as the study’s authors labeled them, were often things like new TVs rather than utilitarian objects like washing machines.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f44683c72e3d2a69e0c8_Ji6cGc8SIvZVhsRNx4A51aePh84wWDtmjfZxgXNZoSrkfDqir-H3eVVWrbIGpoiewW_ddjB-LD2yzHHjBIbWcHZluU4XYmXXMxn_0XNpS9xI227l8X8BsOzZVuPTJp9LJSfU6jas.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Make sure protection plans for products built to last have similar longevity</strong></h2><p>Whether you’re dealing with a manufacturer’s warranty or a product protection plan, most provide coverage for a set period of time. Auto warranties usually last for either a certain number of years or until you reach a certain mileage, whichever comes first. Manufacturer warranties on electronics can last anywhere from 60 days to a year, while appliance warranties typically cover repairs for one or two years. If you expect a product to work well for many years, you might want to consider extending your coverage with a product protection plan. Just be sure your expectation of how long the product will last lines up with the manufacturer’s track record.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f44748047b2cce591ff2_J3-LQ8NLstKlS-rawutgr54_kMWpbgloZUv6ZVMG8DjmnbbGwLEE0dVfDSKPe3Al3vJmdFFnLptSK4GpOX2GYgMHUm3e0A6Pv4_SBsku82u64qvGEtV9T9PH5E2OwjnDw6rTuTJJ.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Confirm whether your credit card already has product protection for purchases</strong></h2><p>Many credit card companies have come up with their own take on extended warranties. As long as you purchase a product with your credit card and the product manufacturer offers a limited warranty, the credit card company will <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/credit-card-extended-warranty">extend the original warranty</a> for an additional length of time. These extra warranties typically last for an additional year, but they often don’t cover big-ticket items like cars, boats, or computers. American Express, Visa, and Mastercard all offer extended warranty benefits, but each card issuer chooses whether to offer them, so you’ll need to check your specific credit card to see if you have this coverage. To take advantage of credit card-sponsored warranties, you usually need to provide your original receipt, credit card statement showing the purchase, and a copy of the manufacturer’s warranty.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/61c0f446402c741036018b5d_7YeUSQBaHhFPPNG8d5KTzoIV8uqh6xJLd_XFuB_hLQ-dp_1nGeYn14l8fP0shZ4Edq5yOKVcFcvi6XyWz6JowUAQeBGtuLFvdyIJ0wo33D688UcaPpKv1Gd28JYxJfir-8YabcDy.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><h2><strong>Be mindful of hidden costs like deductibles</strong></h2><p>While a service plan or extended warranty might seem like a steal upfront, don’t overlook hidden costs that can slip under the radar. Some auto warranties <a href="https://www.autos.com/car-buying/bumper-to-bumper-warranty-hidden-fees-and-limits">won’t cover repairs</a> unless the vehicle has been serviced regularly, for example. Car parts that need to be replaced due to normal wear and tear also sometimes aren’t covered, meaning you’ll need to account for those costs in addition to the price of the extended warranty. Additionally, some product protection plans include a deductible you have to pay each time you get a product repaired. It’s important to account for these costs when you’re weighing the cost of any service plan or extended warranty to ensure you’re making a wise investment.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Photos courtesy Shutterstock users: Canva and Tinnawat Pechrak</em><br></p>	Thu Dec 16 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	annalise-mantz
Why Educated Customers Spend More: Insights from Capitol Lighting's Paul Adams and Clyde's Brandon Gell’s eTail Roundtable	why-educated-customers-spend-more-insights-from-capitol-lightings-paul-adams-and-clydes-brandon-gells-etail-roundtable	Why Educated Customers Spend More: Insights from Capitol Lighting's Paul Adams and Clyde's Brandon Gell’s eTail Roundtable	news-updates	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/603901e9d8c2041fec4b912f_eTail%20Roundtable.jpg	<p>At this week’s eTail Virtual Summit, retail innovators came together to talk about the strategies behind their biggest successes. After nearly a year of pandemic-induced changes to what eCommerce and omnichannel success looks like, there was plenty to discuss.<br></p><p>As part of the conference, Clyde’s CEO Brandon Gell hosted a roundtable discussion with Clyde customer and Capitol Lighting’s COO, Paul Acams. They focused on how to educate and engage customers in a competitive landscape, identifying differentiators that can drive sales.<br></p><p>We’ve collected the wisdom shared in that conversation here, grouped under three main questions:<br></p><ul><li>How has COVID changed how companies approach omnichannel retail, or selling in general?</li><li>How are retailers becoming more customer-centric?</li><li>What do people know about extended warranties, and what are their experiences with them?<br></li></ul><h3><strong>How has COVID changed how companies approach omnichannel retail, or selling in general?</strong><br></h3><p>It’s never been more important to be selling everywhere. Paul shared that his company, Capitol Lighting, had a five-year plan for eCommerce all set up before the pandemic hit. Then they raced through that five-year plan in five months.<br></p><p>“‘We were prepared to [pivot] from an omnichannel experience, but not prepared for the type of growth we saw,” he said, explaining that they were able to really unlock eCommerce potential after just a three-day sprint, since they had already invested in their technology and roadmap.<br></p><p>“Now we’re about five years ahead, and anyone that didn’t do that is behind,” he added, noting that his company was able to capture significant market share from competitors who weren’t as prepared to make that shift.<br></p><p>Other timely changes to opportunities and priorities include:<br></p><ul><li>Transforming B2B sales. Shoppable eCommerce sites are still relatively new in B2B retail, said a participant who is focused on unlocking more sales in that space. What does tech-enabled selling look like in relationships that are usually maintained via personal contact? Well, it should start with creating a better user experience. “Many sites are really transactional, not designed or built with UX in mind,” shared Paul. “Conversion rates are really low because it doesn’t go through a story, answer their questions, or follow customer flow.” There’s an opportunity for retailers to help their distributors with educational resources and marketing materials.</li><li>Standardizing pathways. For companies who work with dozens of manufacturers or distributors, creating one-off processes for each is a pain. “Where you have a lot of different distributors, the only way to do it in a scalable way is for them to all do it the same [way, even if they] give you information slightly differently,” said Brandon, who noted that he sees that with Clyde partners all the time, in both B2B and B2C spaces.</li><li>Adapting to changing order values and frequencies. Several participants flagged that while they’re seeing more orders than ever before come through, their average order values are dropping, suggesting that consumers are focusing on more smaller projects versus one or two bigger ones. That, plus snafus with supply chains and shipping, has put pressure on fulfillment and customer success, as well as requiring changes to marketing strategies.&nbsp;</li><li>Prioritizing services. Brandon shared that Clyde merchants usually see major growth in the amount of consumers who are buying directly from them after they’ve added product protection options. The same goes for payment options like pay-as-you-go services. “In putting a payment system together, make sure that across omnichannel your experience is the same,” he said.<br></li></ul><h3><strong>How are retailers becoming more customer-centric?</strong><br></h3><p>As the pandemic has impacted consumers’ buying patterns, disposable income, and goals, some retailers have had a hard time keeping up. The ones that have done well and managed to adapt along with their changing customer base are the ones that stayed close to what those customers needed.<br></p><p>Some retailers completely changed their marketing around, focusing on remote workers instead of small businesses, for instance. Others are investing in customer pain points, diving into product protection, pay-over-time options, and better chatbot support.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To access the detailed customer feedback needed to drive those marketing pivots and checkout improvements, retailers highlighted one key tool: surveys.<br></p><p>Whether automatic post-purchase emails or in-depth interviews compensated with $100 Amazon gift cards, surveys have been key to pivoting along with customers, versus trying to catch up afterwards.<br></p><h3><strong>What do people know about extended warranties, and what are their experiences with them?</strong><br></h3><p>Paul, who’s worked in retail operations for the majority of his career, including for big sellers like Home Depot and Circuit City, has long used protection plans as a business asset to build client relationships and provide solutions.<br></p><p>“When products become technical, there's that barrier to entry where people might be unsure of the product. We need to be able to offer things that are going to make them feel comfortable with not just the product, but how long it will last and whether or not they'll be taken care of,” he said.&nbsp;<br></p><p>And whether retailers are selling $10,000 chandeliers or home office tech, the ideal warranty partner is one like Clyde who can come in and create a customized white-glove solution, says Paul.<br></p><p>“What we find is by offering that total solution, we're guiding them through the experience,” he said of his customers. “We're allowing them to make a purchase that maybe they wouldn't have made otherwise.”</p><p><br><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Learn more about how Clyde can help drive customer satisfaction and sales</a>.</p>	Fri Feb 26 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
Why Extended Warranties Get a Bad Rap, and How They're Changing 	why-extended-warranties-get-a-bad-rap-and-how-theyre-changing	Why Extended Warranties Get a Bad Rap, and How They're Changing 	insurance	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f0da8020ef88fdc13875693_Frame%2045.png	<p>Extended warranties haven’t always been everyone’s favorite kind of contract.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Their less-than-stellar reputation stems from a few issues.<br></p><p>First, extended warranties can be confusing and hard to understand. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969698906000634?via%3Dihub">well-known study in the <em>Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services</em></a> found that a “large majority” of consumers misunderstand the terms and conditions, including the coverage period, of extended warranties they purchase.<br></p><p>Second, actually getting coverage through extended warranties can be complicated. A 2018 <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/extended-warranties/buying-guide/index.htm"><em>Consumer Reports</em> survey</a> found that 17% of people who had appliances repaired under extended warranties thought the fix took an unreasonable amount of time. 23% of the time, they reported that it took more than one try to get the item properly fixed. (People who paid for repairs out of pocket had fewer issues with timeliness and quality of repairs.)&nbsp;<br></p><p>And third, extended warranties can be overpriced. Per <a href="https://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20170921.html">Warranty Week</a>, a “huge chunk” of the cost of product protection plans go towards salespeople’s commissions. <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/extended-warranties/extended-car-warranties-an-expensive-gamble/"><em>Consumer Reports</em> found</a> that for some types of product protection, like extended car warranties, consumers spend more on coverage than they save in repair costs.<br></p><p>But extended warranties don’t have to be confusing, hard to actually use, and expensive. When done right, warranties can give consumers peace of mind and make their lives easier if anything does go wrong. Clyde’s approach to warranties cuts out a lot of the pain points for consumers and streamlines the servicing, all while keeping it affordable for everyone involved. We’ll explain why in the rest of this blog.<br></p><h3><strong>Demystified terms and conditions</strong><br></h3><p>Clyde starts by sharing extended warranty options in clear, easy-to-understand language. Our product protection options clearly articulate what is covered, from accidents to regular wear and tear.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We want buyers to know exactly what they’re getting and to feel entirely comfortable that their needs will be met. They can access detailed information on their plans from their personalized Clyde dashboard and see exactly when their coverage begins and ends.<br></p><h3><strong>Uncomplicated, streamlined claim experience</strong><br></h3><p>Clyde directly manages the claim adjudication process through a transparent, real-time online dashboard. Customers can file claims directly—no sorting through receipts or filling out complicated forms—and see exactly where they are in the approval process.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Our support team is here to help with any issues. We pre-solve problems by pre-filling claims reports with basic information, providing answers to common questions, and making the claims process as simple as possible. This allows customers—especially the 73% of consumers who want to be enabled to solve product and service issues on their own, per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/customer-serve-thy-self-study-140000357.html">market research</a>—to get their claims handled quickly, transparently, and successfully.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>Competitive rates</strong><br></h3><p>Clyde’s product protection rates fluctuate depending on the item in question but are always reasonable. For example, for a purchase of <a href="https://www.xfyro.com/">headphones that cost $250</a>, customers could get one year of coverage for $7, two years for $17, or three years for $25.<br></p><p>Since we handle everything from offering the plans to servicing them, there are no middlemen whose cuts drive up prices for consumers. We set fair rates that let us offer top-notch service, let brands capitalize on available margins, and let customers know their purchases will be fully covered should anything happen.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>The future of extended warranties is here—and it’s us.</strong><br></h3><p>Extended warranties, when done right, provide the opportunity to increase customer loyalty as well as revenue. (When done wrong, everyone’s unhappy, and no one wants that.)<br></p><p>Fixing past problems with extended warranties and creating plans with less jargon, less hoops to jump through, and less sticker shock is better for the buyer, better for the seller, and better for extended warranties’ reputation.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Let’s talk about how we can help</a>.</p><p><br></p>	Tue Jul 14 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
Why Flexibility is the Key to Successful Extended Warranty Claims Management	why-flexibility-is-the-key-to-successful-extended-warranty-claims-management	Why Flexibility is the Key to Successful Extended Warranty Claims Management	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/5f4fab8a2457fc3495814daf_One-Size-Fits-All-Blog-Post-1.png	<p>Filing and resolving extended warranty claims should be simple. When something does go wrong with a customer’s product, retailers have the opportunity to turn the distraught customer into a delighted one. But what exactly does this process of wowing a customer look like? It turns out that there is no single right answer.<br></p><p>When it comes to claims programs, there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution. No retailer is the same, so it’s important that your extended warranty provider can support your unique products, workflows, and goals. As retailers evaluate extended warranty providers, they should look for a partner who will thoughtfully design a program that is optimized for their business.<br></p><p>Because no retailer is the same, Clyde has built a product that supports a wide range of claims programs. With Clyde, retailers have the option to run both full replacement programs and repair programs, either fully managed by Clyde or self-managed.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here’s why flexibility is key to warranty claims management:<br></p><h2>Different types of products warrant different types of resolutions.</h2><p>Products that are eligible for extended warranty coverage come in all shapes and sizes. Some products are large and clunky and have thousands of individual parts. Other products are smaller and composed of only a couple of components. Depending on the nature of the product, different types of claim resolutions make sense. The flexibility of your claims program is important because it allows you to deliver the most convenient customer experience possible.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For smaller, daily-use products like consumer electronics, instant resolutions through the distribution of promo codes or gift cards put brand new replacement products into the hands of customers with lightning speed. On the other hand, many retailers of larger, more complicated products will prefer that those products are repaired rather than replaced if possible for R&amp;D and customer experience considerations. With larger, clunkier products, the ability to seamlessly provide repairs can also ensure customers avoid a scenario in which they are left to deal with getting rid of the old defunct product if it is replaced.&nbsp;<br></p><h2><strong>Dynamic claims management allows retailers to maximize the revenue they can drive from their warranty program.</strong></h2><p>Actuaries are smart folks and will figure out how to quantify any type of risk. One thing they take into account when underwriting extended warranty programs are the resolution types that will be offered to customers. Partnering with a highly flexible extended warranty provider offers retailers the opportunity to prioritize how they drive their revenue. If a retailer wants to prioritize guaranteed upfront revenue, a seamless repairs platform and access to a highly trusted servicer network permit them to offer higher margin and higher attaching repair plans. If retailers choose to prioritize replacement revenue, instant adjudications and resolutions will deliver passive, incremental revenue from the sale of new products.<br></p><p>Dynamic, flexible claims management is a huge value-add for retailers because it puts them in the driver’s seat, allowing them to develop a warranty program that helps achieve their particular business needs and goals.<br></p><h2><strong>Warranty claims management should be able to slot right into retailers’ existing customer support workflows.</strong></h2><p>Many retailers choose to integrate claims management into their existing customer support workflows. This model makes a lot of sense for many OEMs who can expertly provide their own repair services rather than outsource it to a third party less familiar with their particular product. Clyde is happy to support this model and has built a suite of tools to make this type of integration incredibly seamless. Clyde’s highly flexible set of claims tools empowers retailers to support their customers in a way that works best for their teams.<br></p><p>Every retailer brings a unique set of products, workflows, and challenges to the table, and their extended warranty solution should be reflective of the unique nature of their business. The flexibility of a claims program will ensure that a retailer’s exact needs and goals are met and that their customers are consistently wowed by the simplicity and ease of their experience.</p><p><br></p>	Wed Sep 02 2020 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	jacob-stein

Two things they’re great at are underwriting and administering contracts so consumers can protect the things they care about. Insurance companies have also produced some of the most brilliant and memorable marketing campaigns ever — any business could learn a thing or two from them. However, developing and deploying awesome B2B software is not an area in which insurers excel.

As it stands, only the biggest retailers have the reach to partner with insurers in order to offer extended warranties to their customers. While companies like Apple, Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart provide insurers a ton of business, the market for extended warranties is still largely untapped.</p><blockquote>The software we develop is engineered to allow insurers to remain focused on their strengths while increasing their access to new streams of revenue.</blockquote><p>Clyde adds value to this market by doing the heavy lifting in order for insurers to be able to offer their services to businesses that were previously difficult to reach.

Will OEMs Embrace A New Business Model In 2021?	will-oems-embrace-a-new-business-model-in-2021	Will OEMs Embrace A New Business Model In 2021?	research	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/601d5e6b105b07854a0ec5b5_Direct%20to%20Consumer%20-%20Option%202.jpg	<p>If you’ve bought a new fridge in the last few years, chances are it talks to you. Or has a built-in touchscreen for recipes and family calendars. Or integrates with Alexa or has a door alarm or can be opened with a push instead of a pull.<br></p><p>Home appliances have gotten smart, and so have the consumers who are buying them. Along with the changes in must-have features for a new fridge, dishwasher, oven, washer, or dryer have come changes in buying patterns.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Instead of visiting a showroom and having a salesperson walk them through their options, many consumers are buying appliances directly online. What does that mean for overall sales numbers? What new opportunities are there for enterprising online sellers? And how can OEMs get in on the action?&nbsp;<br></p><p>We take a look at all of that here.<br></p><h3><strong>What are OEMs?</strong><br></h3><p>OEMs are original equipment manufacturers. They’re companies whose goods are either used as components in other companies’ products, as in the case of auto manufacturing, or are finished products in their own right, and are sold to retailers. An example would be Whirlpool making a washing machine that Lowe’s sells to an end user.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>How has the OEM business model worked in the past?</strong><br></h3><p>Let’s look at the <a href="https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/history/">Whirlpool story</a>.<br></p><p>Way back in 1911, a man and his uncle started the Upton Machine Company, selling wringer washing machines to businesses like the electric company. After a few years of good sales, they landed Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. as a customer, when the retail giant was still a catalogue-only sales company. Sales grew, especially when Sears started opening brick and mortar stores, and skyrocketed in the post-war race to stock the suburbs. They expanded internationally, acquired competitors, diversified—and somewhere along the way, picked up a cooler name.<br></p><p>Today, Whirlpool sells approximately $20 billion worth of products annually, the overwhelming majority of which are sold through big box stores like Lowe’s, Home Depot, and Best Buy.<br></p><p>All this without owning a single store of their own.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Being an OEM has pros: there's less of an emphasis placed on marketing and brand awareness, allowing for more attention to be paid to making excellent products.&nbsp;You can avoid the added operational burden of running stores; the retailers who sell what you’re making will figure out what customers want to hear about it.<br></p><p>But it has cons, too: OEMs can’t control the way their products are sold and they don’t have a direct line to the people buying their products.&nbsp;<br></p><p>At the end of the day, OEMs have a similar risk/reward setup to people whose entire businesses are based on platforms like Instagram. So long as that platform exists as a sales channel, things are rosy. But what happens if Instagram—or big box retailers—are marginalized or go away altogether one day?<br></p><h3><strong>The future of OEM retail</strong><br></h3><p>In the economic recovery from the 2008 recession, the housing market rebounded, which drove an increase in sales of home appliances. A <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-appliance-sales-growing-sears-shrinking-0211-story.html">2018 article</a> found that American spending on major consumer appliances rose 46% between 2012 and 2017, and that big box stores saw a lot of those dollars: “Retailers with a bricks-and-mortar presence also benefit from the fact that most shoppers — like the Cooks, who scouted products online before checking out top contenders at Lowe’s — still want to see large appliances in person before buying.”<br></p><p>Enter the pandemic.<br></p><p>With in-person shopping unavailable or dangerous, many consumers are heading online to buy things they would’ve normally wanted to buy in person. Even cars! I was on a walk the other day and spotted three cars with Carvana license plate holders that said the cars had been bought online. Admittedly, that was in Austin, Texas, home to a fast-growing tech scene, but still, it’s a harbinger of the increasing trend of buying everything, from groceries to appliances to automobiles, online.<br></p><p>In fact, a <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/consumers-move-online-to-buy-appliances-snap-chart/">2021 Bain survey</a> of more than 6,000 global consumers found that 26% are more willing to buy appliances online, and that this major shift in buying behavior will accelerate the switch from in-person to digital sales channels by two to five years.<br></p><p>What does that mean for our OEMs? Well, in the short term, good things; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/22/915240713/shortage-of-new-refrigerators-leaves-appliance-shoppers-out-in-the-cold">demand is up</a> and so are sales.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But if this trend continues in the long term, it puts OEMs at a crossroads. They could continue to sell via big box retailers, sure. But if those retailers are just putting some product photos on a search-engine-optimized website, and not contributing to higher average order values with in-person upselling, why shouldn’t the OEM get in on that market and start selling their products themselves, cutting out the middleman?<br></p><p>That’s what Whirlpool is starting to realize, it seems. They recently added a shopping cart function to their website. While you can still figure out “where to buy” a given product at an in-person retailer near you, they have an online checkout option now, too. It’s a little clunky, but they’re leaning in and trying to grab a slice of that eCommerce pie:</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/601d5e7b2e6aed77a2d26118_fRba6irEmex0GE2FU_5olB7BvFAmhR8M2pLuDI0O2dpUmcHy2xdgTgUix5XZdU7NaIuUODahiX7jbR0LB2OCoFVHiq1jpv1R9O209c326VzDlyEp_HgNYlhASDDJyeoEh4u4Fgtt.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>And it looks like their appetite will only continue. Here’s a job posting from the Whirlpool website that was live as of the end of January 2021, when this blog was written, looking for an eCommerce expert with direct-to-consumer experience to build out their online marketplaces in Latin America:<br><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/601d5e7c0f042d5ad9da3206_5Tm2m_gG7rsqCd3M3gcj1KgfCzRfc-Nd5aB46KTGUhSV6Tu7c3dedg0LGjDVXm3gEnBedr7OmtY48MhkIHvXMWUPdXEBV_X89extWmdF5WQXkv790Dlg5rDJmeqIrPYAshCVpClq.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p><br></p><p>The ongoing pandemic has changed our buying habits, and probably for the long-term. If we’re buying things online that previously we wanted to see, touch, or experience in person—from fruit to formalwear—why assume appliance sales will ever go back to the way they were before?<br></p><h3><strong>Opportunities ahead, for the savvy OEM</strong><br></h3><p>It might seem scary to OEMs to break away from a traditional model and lean into eCommerce. Why fix something that isn’t broken?&nbsp;<br></p><p>But big box stores might not be the best partner for an OEM, particularly if they’re not adding extra value with in-person salesmanship. And who’s to say that those retailers will even be around in 18 months? If there’s anything we’ve learned from this last tumultuous year, it’s that hanging on isn’t easy. Just ask JCPenny and Sears, both of whom <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/retail-apocalypse-timeline-infographic/">recently filed for bankruptcy</a>.<br></p><p>Building a functioning eCommerce marketplace is a smart next step for OEMs who want to be in control of their own future. And there are plenty of tools and integrations that can make that investment an even more profitable one—like Clyde.<br></p><p>Clyde partners with retailers to offer extended warranties directly to consumers. OEMs know the impact warranties can make on a company’s bottom line—they pioneered the industry, sending postcards directly to buyers or having salespeople sell add-on warranties directly in-store.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With Clyde, retailers can see attachment rates like those they’d seen on in-person sales, facilitated by a completely-customizable, automatic product protection program that integrates seamlessly into their checkout process. It takes minutes to set up and can be up and running on day one, providing full data reporting and analysis so retailers can dig into exactly how it’s working, if they want—while not having to tinker under the hood if they don’t.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A warranty program through Clyde isn’t a question of whether retailers will make additional profit without additional effort—it’s a question of how much.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.joinclyde.com/connect">Set up a demo</a> to see how Clyde works for retailers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	Fri Feb 05 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	katherine-plumhoff
Working With Clyde: Swanwick Is Powering Productivity And Quality Of Life	working-with-clyde-swanwick-is-powering-productivity-and-quality-of-life	Working With Clyde: Swanwick Is Powering Productivity And Quality Of Life	e-commerce	https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6192ce1d24f1e2c8d7ea71f8_Influencer%20Blog%203.jpg	<p>At Clyde, we're fortunate to work with some of the most innovative brands in the eCommerce space. And once we've begun working with a merchant, we have a vested interest in putting that company's warranty program in a position to succeed, while helping them forge closer relationships with their customers. </p><p>The eCommerce boom of the past 18 months has increased competition within the retail space, both online and in-store. And with access to consumers coming at a premium in 2021, we're doing our part to help our merchants grow their respective businesses. This is why we're featuring some of our top merchants in our "Working With Clyde"&nbsp;series. In our first installment, meet Swanwick. </p><h3>Swanwick Is Powering Productivity And Quality Of Life </h3><p>As lines between professional and personal lives were blurred in the past year and a half, avoiding burnout has become a hot topic. Meditation apps, curated meal options and at-home exercise experiences have flooded the market, all in the pursuit of improving people’s quality of life while making them more productive when they’re working. Without a consistent amount of sleep, however, all of these innovations are rendered mute. Enter Swanwick.&nbsp;</p><p>Swanwick’s Blue Light Blocking Glasses were designed to increase the duration and quality of an individual's sleep. But those tangible gains were only the beginning. A 2020 study by the University of Washington and Indiana University was published in the Journal of Applied Psychology confirming the positive impact Swanwick glasses provide. The quality and quantity of their subject’s sleep, along with their effectiveness at work the next day increased. Over 11% of subjects reported that the quality of their sleep increased, leading to a 9% improvement in work performance and engagement.&nbsp;</p><div></div><p>The $71 billion sleep aid market is largely targeted at people with sleeping disorders. Medications and herbal remedies impact some brain chemicals and the body’s natural circadian rhythms. But these aids often come with side effects and require strict adherence over a long period of time to ensure consistent results. The beauty of Swanwick’s design is that it offers safe and non-addictive alternatives to medications and aids. The benefits of <a href="https://www.swanwicksleep.com/products/classic-night-swannies">blue light blocking glasses</a>, particularly in a non-stop digital age, extend beyond sleep. Blue light’s impact on individuals’ overall health is still being studied. A decrease in vision quality and focus, as well as an increase in anxiety levels have been correlated to over exposure to blue light.&nbsp;</p><p>The beauty of this technology and specifically Swanwick’s array of glasses is that wearers can still enjoy their modern digital lifestyle. A University of Arizona study by Dr. Michael Grandner found that Night Swannies "have managed to combine effectiveness at filtering sleep-disrupting light while also allowing in non-sleep disrupting light, striking the right balance between sleep benefits and wearability and thus allowing for comfortable reading, screen viewing and night time activities without appearing too dark."&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><a href="https://www.swanwicksleep.com/" target="_blank"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c969271de17432fb01a479a/6192cda3553b73a531028394_NIght%20Swannies.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></a></figure><p>Neurologist and sleep expert Dr Chris Winter, MD, dubbed “The Sleep Whisperer” by Arianna Huffington, agrees.&nbsp;“I recommend them to my patients all the time because, in terms of sleep improvement strategies, I'm not sure that there's anything easier and more effective."</p><p>Swanwick co-founder and CEO Tristan Swanwick said the studies showing the benefits of Swannies was an exciting development in sleep research. <em>"</em>We've known for a long time that our glasses are beneficial for sleep but now we know they also help you be more effective and motivated in a work environment."</p><p>To learn more about Swanwick's offerings and how they could help improve your quality of life, check out their website <a href="https://www.swanwicksleep.com/">here</a>. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	Mon Nov 15 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)	michael-calabrese
